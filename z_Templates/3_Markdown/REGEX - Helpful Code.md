# RegEX - Helpful Code

- [!] NOTE TO SELF: THIS STUFF IS ***DANGEROUS - BE CAREFUL*** - TEST IT BEFORE YOU PRESS GO ON SOMETHING YOU MIGHT LATER REGRET

This is Regex Code that can do some really useful stuff. It's not a template but should instead be used in a RegEx Text Editor such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

All code is presented as a FIND and then a REPLACE. Use this in a replace function within the text editor.
