Use \%\% to enclose comments, which will be parsed as Markdown, but will not show up in the preview.

```markdown
Here is some inline comments: %%You can't see this text%% (Can't see it)

Here is a block comment:

It can span
multiple lines

## Obsidian Developer Notes

We strive for maximum capability without breaking any existing formats, therefore we use a slightly unorthodox combination of flavors of markdown. It is broadly CommonMark, with the addition of some functionality from GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), some latex support, and our chosen embed syntax.

These examples were taken and modified from the [Obsidian Help Site](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes).
