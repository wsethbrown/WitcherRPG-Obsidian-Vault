## Common Superstition (Education DC:16)
```ad-quote
Sirens’re a sad story. Used to be beautiful women with tails like fish and a special interest in sailors, heh. That times’s long past though. These days a siren’d sooner flay ya than kiss ya–best keep that in mind. Nobody knows why, but it’s probably to do with sailors kidnappin’ sirens to wife. Today they lure in folk with their songs, then turn into horrible monsters and tear the flesh from your bones. Sailors say if ya pass by sirens on the sea ya should tie yourself to the mast to stop yourself from leapin’ over the edge to ‘em.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:14)
Don’t tie yourself to the mast. You will die a horrible death. Contrary to popular belief, sirens have no magic to compel men to leap into the water and swim to them. They can only conceal their horrifying fishy features under those of beautiful young women—apparently enough for horny sailors who’ve been at sea for the past year. No, a siren lures a ship close with an attractive guise and then bursts into the air on scaly wings to swoop down on its prey. You can see how tying yourself to the mast may be a poor idea. 

A siren will swoop down from on high, swinging with its claws (or its tail if it’s feeling confident) before ascending again. Some will try to knock you into the water where their sisters can better tear you apart. Unfortunately, sirens in the air or in the water are very fast and very maneuverable, making them hard to catch or attack. Luckily you can knock a siren out of the air with a direct ranged weapon hit. In this time the siren is incredibly vulnerable and can usually be finished off by two men with sturdy weapons. Technically, sirens are intelligent, and are capable of reason and diplomacy. That be- ing said, they aren’t interested in it–they see all non-sirens as prey. It’s not entirely unheard of to encounter a siren willing to talk with you. In this case, be very wary: it might be trying to lure you into a trap. Still, old wives’ tales persist that sirens were once friendly. It’s just hard to tell whether these tales refer to the sirens we find off the coast now or a race that (like many others) was wiped out in the numerous race wars.
