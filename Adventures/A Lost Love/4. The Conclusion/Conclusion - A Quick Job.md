Egrin will thank the players for their effort and pay them the agreed amount of coin. He will ask them one last time to attempt to find her, but will not pressure them if the players refuse his request.

Once the Nilfgaardian woman arrives, Egrin and her will get married at the Lordâ€™s manor and the players will be invited to attend.
