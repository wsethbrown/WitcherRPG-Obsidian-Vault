If the players fail to figure out what happened to Iva before the Nilfgaardian noblewoman arrives, then Drek will inform the players that Egrin no longer requires their services, and will offer to pay the players 100 Orens for their help.

Egrin and the Nilfgaardian noblewoman get married at the lordâ€™s manor and the players will be invited to attend.
