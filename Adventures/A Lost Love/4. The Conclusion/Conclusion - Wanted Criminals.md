As soon as the players deliver Iva’s body to Egrin, Iva will appear in her Night Wraith form and immediately kill Egrin, then she will vanish away permanently.

Lord Kozonn and the town will presume the players are responsible for Egrin’s death, and the players will become wanted criminals. Once the Nilfgaardian woman arrives, her Nilfgaardian escort might be dispatched to arrest the players.
