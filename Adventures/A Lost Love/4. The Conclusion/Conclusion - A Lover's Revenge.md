Once the players bring Egrin to Iva, she will kill him immediately and thank the players for allowing her to get her revenge, after which she will vanish.

Depending on the player’s further actions, one of the following will occur:
- Lord Kozonn and the town will presume the players are responsible for Egrin’s death, and the players will become wanted criminals. Once the Nilfgaardian woman arrives, her Nilfgaardian escort might be dispatched to arrest the players.
- Lord Kozonn will host a public funeral for his son that the players may attend before he is laid to rest in the family tomb.
