Egrin will thank the players for finding Iva and allowing her to rest in peace. He will pay the players the agreed amount of coins.

If the players share enough evidence with Egrin that clearly shows Lord Kozonn was responsible for Iva’s death, Egrin will share this information with the Nilfgaardian Captain and noblewoman, leading to the arrest of Lord Kozonn. Egrin will then postpone the marriage to think about everything.

If the players choose not to share enough evidence with Egrin that shows Lord Kozonn was responsible for Iva’s death, Lord Kozonn will host the wedding once the Nilfgaardian woman arrives. Egrin and her will get married at the Lord’s manor and the players will be invited to attend.
