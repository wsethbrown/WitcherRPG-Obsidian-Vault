For the layout of the Lord’s manor, refer to the “Lord’s Manor Map” at the end of the adventure, which includes the layout, room descriptions, and guard patrol routes.

Important Notes for the Lord’s Manor:
- If the players are discovered by either the Lord or his guards, they will be assumed thieves, and the guards will attempt to kill the players.
- If the player’s identities are discovered, Egrin and Drek will avoid the players and will refuse to pay  the players if they complete the quest and attempt to collect payment.
- There is an important unfinished letter that can be found in the Lord’s private reading room, if the players investigate that room, do not forget to mention it. If the players read the letter, it reads the following:

```ad-quote
Captain Baldwaf, it has come to my attention that several Temerian deserters have taken up banditry just outside of town. Unfortunately, I lack the capability to eliminate them at this time and I must request that you take care of them once you arrive.

- Lord Kozonn
```
- If the Lord is somehow killed, the Nilfgaardians escorting the noblewoman will install their captain as temporary leadership when they arrive.
