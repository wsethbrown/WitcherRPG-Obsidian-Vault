The Temerian deserters turned bandits inhabit a camp approximately a mile north of town. The deserters are led by Martin Krold, a former Temerian sergeant who abandoned his country after Nilfguaard broke through the Dol Blathanna – Mount Carbon line.

A map of the bandit camp and Martin’s stat block can be found at the back of the adventure. There are a total of 8 deserters, regardless of the number of players. For the stat blocks of the deserters, refer to the “Temerian Deserter” stat block at the back of the adventure. The deserters are not immediately hostile to the players, but they are not friendly either and they will insist that the players leave them alone.
These deserters are the same deserters that were hired by the Lord to kill Iva, and there are a couple of different ways for the players to convince the deserters to confess to this;

1. The players can attempt Verbal Combat with Martin Krold, if the players manage to win the verbal combat, Martin may confess their role in Iva’s death.
2. The players can attempt to physically subdue the deserters, if the players manage to kill or knock out half of the deserters, the deserters will surrender, and either Martin or a surviving deserter will confess to their role in Iva’s death.

If the players succeed in convincing the deserters to confess, either Martin or a surviving bandit will say the following:

“All right, all right, yes, we did have a hand in killing that girl, but it’s not like we took pleasure in it. It was just a job that we were hired to do, and in times like these, you can’t afford to turn down jobs. Not to mention it was a job from Lord Kozonn, if he didn’t take it, we were afraid we would have disappeared along with her.

If you want to find her body, you can find it hanging from a weeping willow by a pond approximately 2 miles east of town.”
```

If the players managed to convince to bandits to confess, then the complexity of the mystery is reduced to 0.

If the players decide to the job is done and report to Drek with their knowledge to collect their reward, go to Conclusion: A Quick Job.

If the players decide to investigate the weeping willow tree, go to Development: The Weeping Willow.
