Upon arriving at the oneiromancer’s hut, the players will notice that the sole window has its shutters closed and the door leading into the hut is closed. Small flickers of light can be seen from under the front door and on the edges of the shutters. Moza the oneiromancer is inside reading a book about Nilfgaardian customs. If the players knock on the front door she will greet them warmly, inquiring who the players are and why they are visiting her.

Once the players explain to her that they are visiting her for her assistance in a case, she will say the following:
```ad-note

“I can certainly try to help you, but it is of the utmost importance that you uncover as much truth as you can about what happened to this girl. The more details that you can provide me, the less obscure the dreams will be. If you believe you’ve uncovered all that you can, we can get started tonight, otherwise, come back once you believe you have uncovered what you can. And naturally the details about payment for my services, I’ll need 200 Orens before we begin.”
```
If the players wish to begin dreaming, go to Cliffhanger: Dreams of the Past.
