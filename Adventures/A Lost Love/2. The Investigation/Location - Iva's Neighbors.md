While one of the neighboring homes seems to have been long abandoned, the other is inhabited by a young family. The occupants are Aaron and his wife Jenny, who work the vineyard’s lands. While friendly, they are resistant to answering any questions about Iva or from non-humans.

**Clue**: Interrogation **(Verbal Combat or Opposed Social skill checks (use either the laborer or bandit stat block for either). Obfuscation 2. 1d10 + EMP damage)** 
One night some time ago, they heard loud banging noises coming from Iva’s house. When they came outside to check what was going on they saw a group of men outside of Iva’s house, one of them was dragging a large sack outside of the house and another was starting to board up the window. 

The unknown men immediately noticed the couple and threatened their lives if they told anybody about what they saw. The couple assumed it was some kind of robbery and complied with the men’s request. While the men’s identities are unknown, the couple did notice that the men all wore face coverings and damaged blue brigandine.

*Optional Obstacle:*

Gossip Mill: If the players either failed their integration evidence check or made the couple angry, they will gossip with the other villagers about how some outsiders are trying to stir up trouble in the village. The resulting gossip will cause the players to have a -2 to any social interactions with town village NPCs.
