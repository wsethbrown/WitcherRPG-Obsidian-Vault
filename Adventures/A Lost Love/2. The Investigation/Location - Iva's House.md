Iva’s house is a small single-story hut sandwiched tightly between neighboring homes. Like all the other nearby homes, hers is quite old and in poor shape. The home has one window boarded up from the outside and the only door is seemingly stuck. The ground around the house is wet and muddy.

**Clue**: Tracking **(Wilderness Survival DC: 18. Obfuscation 3. 1d6 + INT damage)**. 
While most of the footprints near the house seem quite ordinary and fresh, a couple under the window stand out to you. They are significantly deeper than the others and seem to be left by some kind of boot. Unfortunately, the prints that lead further away from the window seem to have been destroyed by recent rain and the foot traffic of others, rendering them unable to be followed.

The door may be forced open with a **DC: 16 Physique** check. The wood that is boarding up the window can be pried off with either a DC: 20 Physique check or thieves’ tools can be used to pull the nails out of the wood.

The inside of the house is disheveled, with various objects and furniture laying around.

**Clue**: Investigate the Scene **(Perception DC: 14. Obfuscation 0. 1d6 + INT damage)**. 
The door wasn’t hard to open because it was jammed, but because it was being held shut by a piton nailed into the floor. Between the window being barred and the door being held shut, it would seem that somebody is intentionally hiding what happened here.

**Clue**: Investigate the Scene **(Perception DC: 16. Obfuscation 0. 1d6 + INT damage)**. 
There are signs of some kind of struggle happening within the home. Some splats of blood can be found on the walls and floor of the home, and it seems like something was dragged out through the door.

*Optional Obstacle:*
Red Herring: An unpaid invoice for meat totaling 80 Orens from a local farmer named Huld can be found lying on the floor. If the players pass an Evidence Analysis **(DC: 14 Deduction)**, they find a very faint date on the bottom of the paper, dating it to over a year ago. Alternatively, the players may seek out Huld to ask him about it, he can be found in a house on the edge of the village and will tell the players that the invoice was paid well over a year ago.
