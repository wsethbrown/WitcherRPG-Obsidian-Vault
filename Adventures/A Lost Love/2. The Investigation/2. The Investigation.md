# 2. The Investigation
The players will be using the investigation system to solve this mystery. The mystery Complexity is 35 and the following location sections will include possible clues and optional obstacles for the players. A map of the village can be found at the back of the adventure with the exact location of these sections. Once the players find enough clues to reduce the complexity to 0, go to Development: What to do?

If the players need more clues, feel free to create some that you think would fit the story.

If the players want to attempt to sneak into (or somehow enter) the lord’s manor, go to Development: The Lord’s Manor.

If the players want to skip the investigation and go right to Moza the oneiromancer, go to Cliffhanger: The Oneiromancer.

If the players fail to solve the mystery or find Iva before a week has passed, go to Conclusion: Out of Time.

If the players can cast Oneiromancy and would like to skip over the town’s oneiromancer, they can summon the same dreams as the town’s oneiromancer would in Cliffhanger: Dreams of the Past.
