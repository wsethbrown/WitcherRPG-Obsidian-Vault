**Clue: Gossip (Streetwise DC:16. Obfuscation 2. 1d6 + EMP damage)**. 
While most villagers are hesitant to talk with the players, with the right ear they can be overheard gossiping about a group of bandits that the lord is supposedly hiring to do his dirty work. Some believe they are encamped just north outside the village.

If the players attempt to confront the bandits, go to Cliffhanger: The Temerian Deserters.
