Once the players arrive, Moza will bring them into her hut and ask for her payment, after the players pay, she will bring them into her hut and say the following:
```ad-note

“Before we begin, it is imperative that you simply do as I ask and speak honestly about what you know. Now, tell me what you know about this missing girl.”
```

After the players have finished telling Moza what they decide to tell her, she will say the following:
```ad-note

“Now that you’ve shared with me what knowledge you can, now to continue. I need to know which of you wishes to experience these dreams and for that person to make themselves comfortable on the bed. 

When you are ready lay back and close your eyes, and I shall do the rest.”
```

Read the following dreams to the player that decides to experience the dreams.
```ad-note
title: Read Aloud
collapse: open

“In your first dream, you see Egrin arguing with a large ape-like animal in a bedroom. Egrin is sobbing as the ape seems to scream and destroy various objects within the room. Eventually, Egrin goes to weep in his bed and the animal leaves the room.”
```

```ad-note

“In your second dream, you see the same animal talking with some large monstrous white lilies. The animal hands the lilies a pouch and then the lilies leave out a door.”
```
```ad-note

“In your third dream, you see the same lilies throw open the door of a hut and grab the ghostly image of a woman. The lilies drag the woman out of her hut and into the night”
```

If the players defeated the complexity of the investigation and shared the clues with Moza, then the dreaming player will get the following additional dream.

```ad-note

“In your fourth dream, you see the lilies viciously beating on the woman underneath an old weeping willow tree. Then you see one of the lilies throw a noose over a branch of the tree.”
```

After the player is read these dreams, their character has nightmares for a few hours before they wake up. Once the player does wake up Moza will say the following:
```ad-note
title: Read Aloud
collapse: open
icon: horn-call
“Ah, I’m glad your awake, so tell me, what did you see in your dreams?”
```

She will then intently listen to what the player says. If the players mention the old weeping willow tree she will say:
```ad-note
title: Read Aloud
collapse: open
icon: horn-call
“An old weeping willow you say? I know of one just two miles east of town by a small pond. That might be something worth investigating”
```

After the players finish speaking with Moza she will say the following:
```ad-note
title: Read Aloud
collapse: open
icon: horn-call
“Farewell, and Good luck to you, I do hope you find what you’re looking for.”
```
