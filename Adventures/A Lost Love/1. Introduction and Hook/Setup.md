As you enter the small village of Wolveswater, a man who appears to be a peasant approaches you and says;
“Excuse me, travelers, might I bother you for but a moment of your time? My name is Drek, I am a servant for Egrin of the Kozonn estate, my master is looking for folks who aren’t from this area to help him with a discreet task, and to my eye, you look like you would be the ideal kind of people to help. While I cannot say what the pay will be, I can assure you the reward is worth the effort. So, are you interested?”
