Drek is unable to answer any questions the players may have for him about the task, as the details are kept secret from him. Assuming the players are interested in hearing more about the task he will say the following;

“Excellent, I had a hunch you folks would be interested. I shall inform my master to meet you at the Jolly Goose Tavern, it can be found just up the road. When you get there ask the innkeeper, Clyde, for a mug of Clennia Rosso with a pinch of Thyme and he shall take you to meet with Egrin.”
After which Drek will leave the players and return to the Kozonn Estate to inform Egrin of the player’s interest in the task.
The players can easily find the Jolly Goose Tavern by heading up the road for a few minutes. The tavern itself is very average looking, except for the sign depicting a goose drinking from a mug. When the players enter the tavern, they are greeted by the innkeeper, and he says the following;

“Greetings friends and welcome to the Jolly Goose, anything that I can get for you?”

When the players give him the password, he will say the following;

“Of course, but I’ll have to head to the cellar to get a bottle, we don’t keep the expensive stuff out here. Why don’t you come with me so you can pick the vintage yourself”

After which he will lead the players out the back of the tavern and down into the cellar. In the back of the dark cellar sits a table with a lit lantern sitting upon it. The innkeeper will point to the table and say the following;

“Take a seat here, and your guest will be with you as soon as he arrives”

The innkeeper then leaves the players and returns to the tavern. Approximately 20 minutes pass before a hooded figure approaches the players and says the following;

“So, I trust that you are the travelers Drek told me about, I’m Egrin, now before I tell you the details about what I’d like to hire you for, why don’t you tell me about yourselves?”

After speaking Egrin lowers his hood and leans against the wall of the cellar as he listens to the players. Should he be convinced that the players are capable of helping him, he begins his pitch to the players. If he isn’t entirely confident the players are capable of helping, he continues anyway, as he knows he likely doesn’t have the time to find someone more suitable.

“Well, you seem like the right kind of people for the job. Now before I tell you the details, I trust that this information will stay between us, for both your safety and mine. 

I need you to investigate the disappearance of somebody dear to me, her name is Iva. She and I were supposed to get married some time ago, but my father, Lord Hedrigen Kozonn, disapproved of her due to her coming from non-noble blood. When he somehow found out that we were planning to secretly get married he flew into a rage and told me to forget about her and to instead peruse a Nilfgaardian noblewoman who is very fond of my musical performances.

While it broke my heart to do so, I had no choice but to follow my father’s commands, but before I could tell Iva the news she disappeared. I tried looking for her everywhere, but I couldn’t find her at her home nor could I get in to look, nobody has ever seen her here since the day my father confronted me. I fear that he may have had something to do with her disappearance.

Since she was nowhere to be found, I agreed to marry the noblewoman and she is due to arrive here in a week from now, I need you to find out what happened to Iva before she arrives, as I couldn’t live with myself if I moved on to another and she was still out there to be found.
Naturally, you’ll be paid for your effort, 500 Orens if investigate the matter for me, and 1000 if you manage to find her.”
If the players agree to help, he will say the following;

“Thank you, kind folks, very much, I’d like you to start your investigation at her house, since I couldn’t get in, I can’t help but think somebody made it that way too on purpose. If you find anything of interest, a local oneiromancer named Moza may be useful in using what you find to get a glimpse of the past. She can be found in a hut on the western edge of the village. And whatever you do, please do not go near the manor, as I don’t want you to risk provoking my father’s ire.

If you find Iva, or what happened to her, come find Drek at the Tavern, and he will fetch me. Good luck friends and gods willing you find Iva”

After speaking with the players, Egrin will pull his hood back over his head, leave the cellar, and return to the estate.
