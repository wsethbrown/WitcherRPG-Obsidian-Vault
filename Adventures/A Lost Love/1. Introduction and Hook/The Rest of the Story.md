A popular hometown bard, Egrin, was set to secretly marry a peasant girl named Iva, but his father, Hedrigen Kozonn, did not approve of the marriage when he discovered their plans. As the Kozonn family is a minor nobility, Hedrigen couldn’t stand his family line being sullied by a peasant’s blood. Hedrigen confronted Egrin, telling him to forget about the peasant and to instead pursue Denia, a Nilfgaardian noblewoman who is very fond of Egrin. While it broke his heart, Egrin submitted to his father’s demands, and unknown to Egrin, Hedrigen had Iva abducted from her house and killed before Egrin could speak with her. Iva’s death was brutal and resulted in her being cursed into a Nightwraith, and she now wonders the woods near her body looking for Egrin, whom she believes had a hand in her death.

These events took place weeks ago, and now Egrin is set to marry Denia, the Nilfgaardian noblewoman, in a week from now when she arrives from her journey. But before the marriage, Egrin wants somebody to find Iva, as he hasn’t seen her since his father confronted him and fears that his father had something to do with her disappearance. Egrin wishes to hire the players, as they are unknown to his father, and believes them to have the best probability of finding out what happened to Iva.
