The only good thing to say about traveling the war-ravaged countryside of occupied Lyria is that it is never lacking surprises. Just last night you witnessed the strongest thunderstorm you think you’ve ever witnessed, it almost felt like the heavens were fighting their own war with how much lighting and thunder there was.

And after spending all morning trekking through the muddy countryside roads, you come upon another surprise. A town that is seemly untouched by the war, other than the occasional glimpse of a Nilfgaardian flag waving in the breeze. On your way toward the town, you notice a sign on the side of the road, the sign reads “Welcome to Wolveswater, home of the renown Kozonn Estate”.
