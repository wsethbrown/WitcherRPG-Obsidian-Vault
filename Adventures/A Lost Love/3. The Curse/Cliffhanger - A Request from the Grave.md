If the players allow Iva to speak with them, she will say the following:
```ad-note
title: Read Aloud
collapse: open
icon: horn-call
“Who are you and why have you come here, did you come to make sure those men did their job? To make sure their beating and murder were worthy of Egrin’s gold?”
```
The players may speak with Iva’s ghost and ask her questions, she knows the following information;
1. How the Temerian deserters killed her and what they said while they were killing her.
2. Her relationship with Egrin and the Kozonn family (detailed in her character information).
3. She believes that the curse that binds her to the tree was born from her hatred of Egrin.

Iva cannot be fully convinced that Egrin is not guilty of having her murdered, but she is willing to hear him out if the players present their evidence to her.

After speaking with the players, Iva will say the following to them:
```ad-note
title: Read Aloud
collapse: open
icon: horn-call
It seems to me that my hatred of what Egrin did to me has cursed me to suffer here eternally, but I am prepared to forgive him if it means that I may leave this place. Please, ask him to come here and bury my body, if he does so, then I will forgive him.
```

- If the players refuse to help her, she will attack them, go to Cliffhanger: Fighting the Night Wraith.
- If the players agree to help her, but did not attempt to convince her of Egrin’s innocence, go to Conclusion: A Lovers Revenge.
- If the players agree to help her and attempted to convince her of Egrin’s innocence, go to Conclusion: A Lost Love Reunited.
