## Getting to the Tree
If the players learn about the old Weeping Willow tree, then they can find it without much of a problem. The journey to find the Weeping Willow will take the players approximately an hour as they travel two miles north of town through the forest.

## The Tree
The Weeping Willow tree sits on the edge of a small pond and is fairly large for the species, standing about 15 meters at its highest. The tree and the pond are constantly surrounded by a layer of fog that obscures vision to 10 meters, the top of the fog reaches about halfway up the willow tree. The fog is magical and is related to Iva’s curse, the fog cannot be dispelled unless the curse is removed.

##  Iva's Body
Iva’s body is hanging from a branch 2 meters off of the ground. Her body is passing through the stages of decay, with rotting flesh and some exposed bones. Iva has a simple love letter from Egrin hidden within her clothes that the players can easily find. The letter reads;

My dearest Iva, Words cannot describe the way I feel about you. I will love you until the end of time and I long for the next time I see will see you. – Your Egrin.

## Iva's Curse
While the Temerian Deserters were beating Iva, they also were insulting her, calling her a “cheap slut” and saying that “Egrin had found a Nilfgaardian whore to fuck around with instead of her”. Iva’s brutal death and hatred toward Egrin for his apparent betrayal have led to her being cursed as a Night Wraith.

Iva’s curse can be lifted in one of two separate methods;
1. The players can burn her corpse along with the letter at night, then kill her.
2. The players can accept Iva’s request (see Iva the night wraith) and bring Egrin to her.

A Witcher (or character familiar with curses) may attempt a **DC:14 Witcher Training** check or **DC:16 Education** check to know method 1 above.

If the players simply kill her wraith, this will not lift the curse and she will return the following night.

If the players burn Iva’s corpse with the letter at night, she will be summoned and attack them, go to Cliffhanger: Fighting the Night Wraith.

- If the players decide the job is finished and return to Egrin to collect their reward, go to Conclusion: A Lost Love Found.
- If the players decide to bring Iva’s body to Egrin without removing the curse, go to Conclusion: Wanted Criminals.
- If the players decide to bring Egrin to the cursed area without speaking with her about his innocence in Cliffhanger: A request from the grave, go to Conclusion: A Lovers Revenge.

## Iva the Night Wraith
Iva will wander through the fog from the hours of 9 PM and 3 AM. Her appearance is that of a ghostly woman (not of a night wraith). If she notices the players, she will approach them.

- If the players attack her, she will turn into a Night Wraith and attack the players, go to Cliffhanger: Fighting the Night Wraith.
- If the players do not attack her, she will speak with the players, go to Cliffhanger: A request from the grave.
