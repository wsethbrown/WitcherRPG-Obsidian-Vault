## Common Opinion (Education DC:8)
Heh—bandits, deserters, renegades, whoresons. Whatever ya wanna call ‘em. People turn to crime for money and power, but most of the time it’s out of hunger or fear. Everybody knows ya get a spike of crime when there’s a war on. Happened the last two wars and it’ll happen again. Don’t mean the common man sees it that way. Heh, never say it to a killer’s face, but the average son of a bitch thinks ‘bout as highly of a bandit as they would a damn ghoul. They hide in the filthy crevices of the world, waitin’ to spring out and ambush good, hard-workin’ folk an’ take their hard-won livelihood.

># Levels of Bandits
>Bandits come in a lot of differ- ent skill levels. The bandit presented here is a basic thug— the type of warrior you’d find guarding a criminal’s ware- house or ambushing travelers on the road. If you want, you can alter the bandits’ stats to make them more or less threatening. If you want an average peasant or low-level thug, bring their REF & DEX down to 3 and their HP down to 15. Keep in mind that these bandits won’t be much of a challenge for combat-orient- ed characters. If you want a more veteran warrior, bring their REF & DEX up to 7 or 8 and raise their HP to 35. As you change the Combat Level stats, you can also change skills and gear to augment them further

Bandits are one of the most common threats on the road, but they are far from the most dangerous. You’d have a far worse time prying a ghoul off of you than dispatching a few bandits. But they can still be a significant threat in large groups. The vast majority of bandits are soldiers without an army, mercenaries who have no contract, or deserters from any one of the many armies flooding across the land. Simple sorts, bandits. The front ranks will charge with long swords. Any who can’t will draw their crossbows. Bandits are usually looking for three things: safety, money, and something to take their anger out on. They aren’t exactly easy to deal with but, unlike most monsters, they can be reasoned with. Maybe you can convince them not to try and kill you. Since they aren’t hunting on instinct bandits will likely give up if you do enough damage to them.

However, some who travel in more tightly woven groups may fight all the harder if you kill their buddies. In the war-torn North, be a bit more wary. Lack of easily accessible food has driven some bandits to cannibalism. Cannibals often go a bit mad and attack wildly, refusing to give up even when half dead. If you don’t want a fight, keep a wary eye on the roads.
