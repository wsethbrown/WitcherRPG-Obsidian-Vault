Your next session can be focused on the wedding preparations and the events leading up to the wedding day. Here are some ideas for how to structure the session:

1. Lord Kozonn wants the wedding to be a grand affair, so the players can be involved in helping with the preparations, such as decorating the church, setting up tables, or arranging for the food and drinks. This can be a good opportunity for the players to interact with the townspeople and gather more information about the town and its politics.

2. The players may be approached by Egrin or Denia to perform a special task or solve a problem related to the wedding preparations. For example, the players may need to find a missing wedding present, or deal with a group of bandits who have threatened to disrupt the wedding.

3. The wedding itself can be an eventful occasion, with guests from neighboring towns and lords attending. There may be political maneuvering and intrigue, as different factions try to gain an advantage or secure alliances. The players can be caught in the middle of these tensions, and may need to navigate the social dynamics to keep the peace.

4. Finally, the players can be approached by Lord Kozonn or one of his allies with a task that requires their skills as witchers. This task may be related to the wedding, or it may be a separate mission that the players can choose to accept or decline.

Remember to keep the players engaged and on their toes by introducing unexpected twists and turns. Consider adding NPCs with conflicting motivations, and giving the players opportunities to make choices that impact the outcome of the wedding and the future of WolvesWater.

Based on the situation you've described, there are a few different directions you could take your next session. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

Egrin's wedding: The wedding of Egrin and Denia could serve as a backdrop for a variety of events and encounters. You could have the players interact with the various nobles and dignitaries in attendance, or they could uncover some political intrigue or other conflicts brewing under the surface. You could also have the players deal with any lingering supernatural threats, such as the possibility of another Nightwraith appearing.

Lord Kozonn's motives: With the players having uncovered the truth about Iva's death, they might want to confront Lord Kozonn and bring him to justice. This could lead to a tense and potentially dangerous encounter, as Lord Kozonn is unlikely to admit to his actions and may even try to silence the players.

The Temerian Deserters: The players may decide to track down the Temerian Deserters responsible for Iva's death and bring them to justice. This could involve traveling beyond the safety of WolvesWater and into the wilderness, where they might encounter other dangers and obstacles.

Egrin's future: With the wedding looming, Egrin may have conflicting feelings about his future. He might want to run away with the players or seek their help in breaking off the engagement with Denia. Alternatively, he might have grown more ruthless and willing to do whatever it takes to protect his family's interests, putting the players in a difficult position. These are just a few of the many possibilities available to you, and the players' actions and decisions may lead you in unexpected directions. The most important thing is to be flexible and respond to the players' choices and actions in a way that keeps the story interesting and engaging.

1.  Egrin's guilt over Iva's death may also play a role in his actions and decisions. He may want to make amends for what happened to her and seek the players' help in punishing those responsible for her death.
    
2.  Finally, Egrin's wedding day itself could provide a turning point in the story. The players may be called upon to attend the wedding as witnesses or security, or they may become embroiled in a conflict or situation that arises on the day of the ceremony.

Given the information you've provided, there are a number of potential political machinations that could create interesting problems for the players:
1.  Lord Kozonn's ploy to impress Denia and her father by dressing up Temerian Deserters as Nilfgaardian soldiers could backfire if the ruse is uncovered, putting the players in the middle of a dangerous political situation.
    
2.  Egrin's conflicting feelings about his future could lead him to take dangerous actions, such as attempting to elope with the players or seeking their help in breaking off the engagement. This could put the players in the crosshairs of both Lord Kozonn and Denia's father.
    
**3.  The players may be drawn into a power struggle between Lord Kozonn and Denia's father, as each tries to use the players to gain the upper hand in their negotiations.**
    
**4.  Lord Kozonn may have ulterior motives for his alliance with Nilfgaard, such as using the marriage as a way to gain influence and access to Nilfgaardian resources. This could put the players in a difficult position if they uncover evidence of his duplicity.**
    
**5.  The players could be caught in the middle of a feud between Lord Kozonn and the Temerian Deserters, who may seek revenge for the death of two of their own at the hands of the players.**
    
6.  The players may uncover evidence of Lord Kozonn's involvement in Iva's murder, putting them in a difficult position as they navigate the political landscape of Kaedwen and try to avoid making enemies of the powerful noble.
    
7.  The players' own motivations and allegiances could come into conflict with one another, as they navigate the complex political landscape of Kaedwen and try to protect their own interests.

## How to Point out that Hunytr, Lu Du, and Olsen are Related 
What are some ways they may discover they're related?

1.  A shared physical characteristic: The three brothers might have a distinct physical characteristic that they each inherited from their mother. Upon seeing each other, they might realize that they all have this feature and start to suspect that they might be related.

2.  A family heirloom: They might each come into possession of a family heirloom, such as a piece of jewelry, that is unique to their family. This could lead them to investigate their family history and discover the truth about their relationship.
  
3.  A shared memory: They might each have a vague memory of a woman who played a significant role in their childhood, but they might not have remembered her name or her face. Upon comparing notes, they might realize that they are all talking about the same person and that she was likely their mother.

4.  A chance encounter: They might all come across their mother, who has been searching for them, at the same time and place. This chance encounter could lead to the revelation of their shared relationship.
