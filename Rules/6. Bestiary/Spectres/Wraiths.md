## Common Superstition (Education DC:14)
```ad-quote
Wraiths come in all shapes and sizes from what the tales say. The souls of the dead and the damned, come back to our world to wreak havoc on the livin’. Old wives’ tales ain’t that specific on what makes a wraith, though. Most say that it’s folk who’ve been wronged, or the evilest of whoresons. Some say it’s mages and priests too magical to leave this realm. People can usually agree, if ya wanna get rid of a wraith ya gotta perform a ritual. First, find the corpse, which won’t have rotted, mind ya. Pierce the corpse with an aspen stake, cut off the head and place it between the corpse’s legs, then set the corpse on fire. Ya fail to do even one step and you’re a dead man. Least that’s what people say.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:10)
Interestingly enough, specters are one of the only monster types that are connected to dead people, humans and non-humans. A specter is the spirit of someone who died either in terrible circumstances or with unfinished business. That being said, you can’t banish a specter via the method written above. Most specters must be killed and sent back to the realm of the dead. But those tied to a curse must have the curse lifted to move on permanently. Wraiths are technically sentient, but very few act on this sentience. Most wraiths are consumed by hatred and will lash out randomly at anything that comes near. The remaining 5% or so retain some of their sentience and may speak and interact. Usually these sentient specters are part of a grand curse.

When fighting a specter, keep moving all the time. They will swing widely with their sword and lantern and use their selectively incorporeal nature to ‘dodge’ attacks. Every once in a while a specter will teleport, usually to get behind a target and attack. This is the specter’s most dangerous move, since they literally come out of nowhere. If you catch a specter with a Yrden Sign or a moondust bomb, you can keep it from turning incorporeal or teleporting. That and an application of specter oil will really shorten your fight.
No one knows where a wraith’s consciousness goes when they are destroyed; it has been argued for centuries.
