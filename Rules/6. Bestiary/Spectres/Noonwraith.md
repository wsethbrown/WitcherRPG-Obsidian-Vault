>|**Fueled By Rage** Wraiths are technically as intelligent as they were in life, but they are blinded by overwhelming rage. They cannot be reasoned with or intimidated.|
>|**Incorporeal** A noonwraith is always incorporeal, rendering it immune to physical attacks, bleeding, and poison.|
>|**High Noon Dance** A noonwraith can create 3 copies that dance around, at least 5m away from their target. These clones will not attack but they use the same stats as the Noonwraith in defense. Each copy remain- ing drains 3 points of Health per round from the nearest target to heal the Noon- wraith. Striking a copy will kill it.|
>|**Dust Devil** A noonwraith can use magic to swirl dust and dirt up into a target’s face. This attack uses Spell Casting, and on a hit it blinds the target for 1d6 rounds. The target must be within 5m.|

## Common Superstition (Education DC:16)
```ad-quote
Some say noonwraiths are the souls of young women who got killed right before their wed- dings. Come back as horrid white-clad wretches that haunt the fields when the sun’s highest. Folk say they’re smart, just driven mad with grief and revenge—which makes ‘em kill anythin’ they see. An’ they don’t usually kill with claws or teeth or the like. Legends say they enthrall ya with dark magics and make ya dance with ‘em. Ya can only stop when the sun goes down. But you’ll be long dead by then.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:14)
Young, engaged women who suffered violent deaths before their weddings sometimes come back as noonwraiths. These wraiths are powerful, dangerous, and vindictive creatures. The souls of the women are driven mad with pain and anger that compels them to stalk the fields and lands around their grave, searching for the person that killed them. That’s fair, but they have a tendency to kill anything else that gets too close to them as well. When dealing with a noonwraith, you have to be quick: engaging the creature in melee combat is a necessity. Noonwraiths are incorporeal until you catch them in a Yrden circle or a moondust bomb. This is your only window for physical attacks. You should also en- gage a noonwraith close to sunset, as moonlight weakens the creature.

Noonwraiths usually attack with their deadly claws. From time to time they use magic to sweep up a dust devil and blind a challenging target. If damaged too much, they begin a high noon dance, creating copies of themselves that drain your HP and heal the noonwraith. Destroy these copies immediately, before they can siphon too much health from you. Your best chance to fight a noonwraith is to coat your blade in specter oil and attempt to summon it at night. Find something of great value to the wraith in its previous life and burn it near the grave site. 90% of the time this will summon the wraith, and with the moon high in the sky you will have a much easier time killing it. Once killed, the specter’s soul is released from the shackles of pain that kept it in this world. It is put to rest and can move on to whatever lies beyond the veil of death. This is a romantic goal, but not an easy task.
