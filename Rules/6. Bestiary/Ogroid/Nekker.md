## Common Superstition (Education DC:12)
```ad-quote
Nekkers are horrendous little beasts. Heh, folk say they live under bridges and prey on travel- ers who get stuck or lose their way. They’re little hideous troll-like things that hunt in packs–ya get enough of ‘em together and they’ll strip a horse of flesh in a few minutes. If ya run into a group of nekkers it’s best to spur your horse and ride as fast as ya can. If you’re on foot, ya got one hell of a problem. Heh, try lightin’ a torch and headin’ for a city. Fire should keep ‘em at bay long enough if you’re lucky.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:10)
Nekkers are a quandary for some witchers, a strange middle ground between purely being a monster and being a sentient race. They are short, ugly, bald creatures that tend to hide in holes and caves but will live just about anywhere. They will hunt down anything made of meat that has a heartbeat and devour it from the top of its head to the tip of its toes. This obviously makes them a danger to the world at large, and thus most witchers kill them with no great misgivings. However, nekkers have recently been discovered to be far more intelligent than most give them credit for. They hunt in war bands led by a chieftain, they wear loincloths and headdresses, sometimes carry staves, and in some places even decorate their caves with primitive paintings commemorating battles and hunts that they have gone on. All of this being said, they are still a threat to humanity and other sentient creatures.

If you have to fight a group of nekkers (which you likely will if you travel the war-torn roads in the Northern Kingdoms) keep in mind that nekkers are pack hunters who take orders from a chieftain, and killing it should be a priority. The chieftain will usually wear a skull headdress and carry a staff of some kind. Nekkers will try to gang up on you, so stay moving constantly. Area of effect or cone-based attacks, such as spells or bombs, are good to thin the ranks of the nekkers. Ogroid oil applied to a blade is also a good idea if you have some to hand. Technically, nekkers are somewhat intelligent–with great difficulty you might be able to convince them to leave you alone if you show them more fruitful prey. In general, it’s not a great plan to stake your life on your diplomacy, though.

|Nekker Chieftain|||||
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
Nekker chieftains are usually slightly larger than regular nekkers. Some people think that they are a larger breed of nekker, but it’s more likely that (like humans) larger, more powerful nekkers are chosen to be chieftains. They are often a reddish hue, possibly due to war paint.||||
