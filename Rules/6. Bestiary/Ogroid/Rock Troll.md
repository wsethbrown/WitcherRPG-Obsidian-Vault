># Trolls Under Bridges
>It’s not uncommon to find trolls under bridges or living near to them. This is more common among cave trolls but applies to rock trolls as well. Due to their strength and the formidable crafting skills of cave trolls, they are often hired by towns to maintain bridges and (in some cases) work as guards and toll collectors. Many towns find it easier to hire a troll, since most times they can be paid in vodka and very rarely complain.

## Common Superstition (Education DC:14)
```ad-quote
Most of the things folk know about trolls is about cave trolls, but how different can they be? Heh, everybody knows trolls’re great builders and they work for vodka. Trolls can build all sorts of masonry and whatnot. Ain’t too bright though. Folk say ya can trick a troll into buildin’ a bridge, goin’ away, or just about anything else by promisin’ em a whole keg of vodka, then givin’ ‘em a keg of water and tellin’ ‘em it’s a new recipe. I wouldn’t try it though. Whoresons have got one hell of a punch and I like my head on my shoulders.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:14)
To some extent it is true that cave, rock, and ice trolls are more similar than different. But the differences that do exist are very important, especially if you have to fight one of these brutes. Yes, all trolls are what most people consider stupid. They are about as smart as the average young child and remain that way their entire lives. They are also very fond of alcohol of any variety, though their mass means that it takes vodka and other spirits to really get them drunk. It’s not advisable to trick a troll when it comes to vodka–they are tremendously strong and don’t take well to being fooled. Trolls have tremendously powerful punches which have been known to dent plate armor and crack even the most resilient shields, so dodging their attacks is preferable to trying to block and parrying is out of the question. Trolls of all varieties are very very accurate when it comes to lobbing boulders at distant targets. If you get too far from a troll you are currently fighting it will probably throw large rocks at you, forcing you to dodge and slow down until it can close the distance again. Trolls have also been known to grab and grapple targets, using their incredible strength to their advantage.

Now the differences. Don’t bother hiring rock trolls as builders—they’re useless. Rock trolls are smaller in stature than cave trolls, standing only two meters tall at most. How- ever they are incredibly heavy, with a hard plate of rock on their back that acts as a natural shield against attacks from the rear. This means that unlike cave trolls, you must face a rock troll head on to do real damage to it. Trying to attack through the solid stone on a rock troll does very little damage, and just about any weapon will dull on its stony back.
