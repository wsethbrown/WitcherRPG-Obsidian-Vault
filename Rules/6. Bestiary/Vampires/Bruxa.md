## Common Superstition (Education DC:16)
```ad-quote
Heard tales about bruxa from plenty of folks down south. Maybe it’s somethin’ about the warmer climate but vampires sure seem to tend towards the south. Heh, this one old boy from Nazair once told me, a bruxa’s a nymph like a water nymph or the like. But they’ve been corrupted by dark magic and carnal desires. They come out at night and lie with handsome young men before feedin’ on their blood and sendin’ ‘em to the grave. Heh, yer not likely to kill a bruxa in combat ‘cause they’re faster than any human, with long razor-sharp claws and voices like batterin’ rams. What ya gotta do is stall the bruxa ‘til the sun rises. Moment the sun touches her skin she’ll burn up like a dry hay loft!

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:14)
When a monster is sapient and deceptive enough to hide itself in a human settlement, it becomes very difficult to kill. In addition to this simple truth, bruxa are vampires, and even worse, fall under the terrifying category of those not weak to sunlight. Finding a bruxa in a settlement of humans can be difficult as they are able to blend in with their neighbors. If you walk the streets of a settlement at night, listen for a quiet yet shrill singing that resonates in the pit of your stomach. This is the song of the bruxa, a song they sing in their native language, especially after drinking blood. 
By no means should you take a contract on any sapient vampire, which, I must remind you, are creatures capable of turning completely invisible, an ability against which traditional methods employed against the invisible are of limited aid, striking at blinding speeds, and firing powerful sonic blasts. 
Sneaking up on one is difficult, as bruxa form close connections to birds, which give them early warning of guests. If you must stake your life on the folly of this hunt, keep the element of surprise for as long as you can. Walk the city listening for the sounds of birds and the scent of blood, checking the quieter places in the wealthier districts. Find a place to get your quarry alone, drink a Black Blood Potion, and fill the air with Moondust Bombs, Yrden, and Igni. Oil your silver sword properly, and bring to bear everything you have been taught, and you might live
