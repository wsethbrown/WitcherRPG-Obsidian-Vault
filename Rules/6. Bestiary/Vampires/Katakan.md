## Common Superstition (Education DC:16)
```ad-quote
Heard plenty of tales of vampires while travelin’ ‘round the Continent. Legends say a vampire can turn into a bat or a wolf or the like. Can fly without wings, heal any wound, and claw right through steel. Heh, I hear katakans like to seduce pretty women with their shapeshiftin’ abilities and then drink their blood. Sounds like a whole mess of trouble I’d like to avoid gettin’ caught up in, but if you’ve gotta, keep a head of cut garlic on hand, as well as a holy symbol of your chosen god and a stake to drive through the beast’s heart to kill it for good. Turns out I sell all those items at reasonable prices, by the way.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:14)
Of all monster families, the difference in power from least to most is at its most staggering in vampires. Lesser vampires are quick and agile, stronger than the average man, stealthy as a shadow, and vicious in their attacks. But they are animalistic–often less than fully sentient. At the opposite on the spectrum, the power of a nosferat is so vast as to be almost incomparable. Katakan are a good midway point in the vampire family between bestial lesser vampires and overwhelming, brilliant higher vampires.

Katakans are intelligent creatures, often more so than the average human. They are highly magical, able to hide from all forms of magical scanning including witcher medallions and other divination, and can communicate with prey telepath- ically. They cannot take any form but their own. In combat they are stealthy, hiding behind magical invisibility while they drive their prey mad with telepathic fear tactics. Katakan are hard to kill, regenerating from most wounds very quickly and dancing around attacks with their superior speed. They are still more animalistic than their more powerful cousins and are prone to lick blood off the cobblestones after eviscerating their prey with their claws. Popularly-known protections do not work on a katakan. Most will probably just annoy it, save for the stake through the heart. When fighting a katakan, fire is your best weapon since they are very flammable. Black blood can also be quite useful if the katakan tries to bite and feed on you. Alternatively, remember that any drug or amount of alcohol in your blood will affect a vampire that bites you.
