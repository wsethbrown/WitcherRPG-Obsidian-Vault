>>**Sonic Screech** A siren can take its turn to let out a screech which forces anyone within 10m to make a Stun save at -1.|
>>**Charge** If a target moves more than 10m away from the griffin, it can take a full round to charge and make a powerful claw attack at -4 which does 10d6 damage and knocks the target back 8m. If they strike anything while flying back, the target takes appropriate ramming damage as if from a horse.|
>>**Feral** For the purposes of Awareness and Wilderness Survival, instinct gives them an INT of 8.|
>>**Flight** A siren can take flight as a movement. The siren can only be knocked out of the air by stunning it or doing more than 5 points of damage with an attack. If the siren is knocked out of the air it must make a DC:16 Athletics check or take falling damage based on how far it fell.|
>>**Night Vision** Griffins operate in areas of dim light with no penalties.|

## Common Superstition (Education DC:14)
```ad-quote
Can ya imagine of a more majestic bein’ than a griffin?’ Heh, that’s dangerous thinkin’ if I ever seen it. Most noblemen think of griffins and their kin, gryphons, as majestic beasts that ya put on tabards and heraldry and whatnot. Heh, farmers, on the other hand, are scared to death of ‘em. What’re ya gonna do when a 900 kilo ball of fur, feathers, and claws lands in your field and picks up your cow? Nothin’, that’s what. Most common folk don’t say much about griffins. Just to avoid ‘em.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:14)
Griffins are technically very simple creatures. They operate a lot like a combination between the two beasts that make them up: lions and eagles. Unfortunately, combining lions and eagles effectively creates a super-predator. Griffins are fast on the ground and fast in the sky. They can cross large areas of difficult terrain by flying over it and spot hiding prey with eagle eyes. That doesn’t even take into account how they pick up prey the size of a horse and drop it from 100 meters in the air. Luckily, griffins mostly just attack intruders in their territory. The problem is that with war leaving corpses all over the open fields and valleys, griffins are moving their territories from the high mountains to the low peaks and foothills. Suddenly, small villages at the foot of the mountains are in a griffin’s territory without even realizing it.

If you have to fight a griffin, do yourself a favor and stock up on ranged ammunition and hybrid oil. You’ll need the ammunition because griffins like to attack from the air, swooping down on their opponents. A direct hit with a crossbow bolt, spear, arrow, or other ranged weapon forces the griffin to re-adjust in the air. If it fails, it will plummet to the ground, take falling damage, and be more vulnerable. On the ground you have to watch out for the griffin’s razor-sharp claws. Not only will they tear you open, they leave vast bleed- ing wounds. If you get too far from a griffin it’ll close distance with a charge: a tremendously powerful but inaccurate attack, easier to dodge than the normal claw attacks, but a hit will spell doom for the average man. The last thing to watch for is the griffin’s sonic cry. Fail to resist that and you’ll be a sitting duck.
