## Common Superstition (Education DC:15)
```ad-quote
Wanderin’ through a bog and think ya hear somethin’ move where ya don’t see anythin’? Just lay down and play dead. Probably an arachas, and that spells trouble for you. Arachas are big, nasty whoresons that hide in the flood plains and marshes usin’ some kinda magical camouflage. They’re poisonous as all hell and suprisin’ly agile. Lucky for you, they got shite eyesight so they gotta see ya move. If ya hold still ya might make it. Just gotta sit still as a statue and wait for it to move on.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:16)
Arachas are indeed very dangerous ambush predators. They stalk the swamps and flood plains of the Continent, primarily along the Pontar and the Yaruga, and they apply a sort of camouflage to hide their entire massive body from sight. However this camouflage isn’t magical. An arachas hides its body inside a hollowed-out log or giant shell that matches the environment it lives in. Arachasae are perfectly capable of seeing you if you stand still, and doing so will make you a perfect target. Hunting arachasae prefer to sneak up as close as they can while camouflaged and then pounce on their prey. If the prey notices the arachas and runs, it will shoot sticky webbing at the target to immobilize it before pouncing. Once locked in melee combat an arachas will try to claw the opponent to death, often blocking attacks with its hard pincers and trying to pin their opponent.

When fighting an arachas, apply something to help fight poison, such as gold oriole potion. It’s also good to load up on insectoid oil and, when possible, stay behind the arachas. Arachas back armor is always the weakest—a well- placed strike to the back will usually penetrate. It’s also good to position yourself so a pouncing arachas may plummet off of drops or ram hard objects and take damage. Arachasae are often confused with endrega queens. An endrega queen is so similar to an arachas that many academics believe the two species may be related, with many thinking that arachasae mutated from endrega. The best way to distinguish an arachas from an endrega queen is their location. Arachasae are solitary predators and can be found alone in the wilderness. Endrega queens are found in their nest, surrounded by other endrega.
