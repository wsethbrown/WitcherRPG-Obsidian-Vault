## Common Superstition (Education DC:14)
```ad-quote
Legends say they’re like normal folk until moonlight shines on ‘em, and they turn into horrible mindless monsters. They do nothin’ but eat flesh and drink blood all night until the sun comes up and they transform back. Worst of all, if ya get bitten, you’re doomed to turn yourself. Some folks think you can cure a werewolf by forcin’ the werewolf to drink a tea of wolfsbane three times a day for five days. Others believe ya can cure it just by exhaustin’ the werewolf and then scoldin’ it. Rather have a crossbow.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:14)
Werewolves are dangerous and horrifying beasts that can lie dormant inside totally reason- able people. These huge beasts look like a cross between humans and gigantic wolves. They are merciless monsters with no empathy and a powerful bloodlust. The worst part about these cursed beasts is that they arise from regular people. Werewolves manifest all the cruelty and evil intentions of the cursed person. When a person transforms into a werewolf, usually a process started by the rising of the moon, they lose all shreds of their humanity and are left with only their intelligence and their worst and most vicious urges. 

These beasts are very difficult to fight, owing to their innate intelligence and regenerative abilities, which only a moondust bomb can halt. Luckily, only a curse can create a werewolf—a bite from a werewolf will only cause you to bleed copiously. If you find yourself fighting a werewolf, skip all of the useless peasant cures and find a silver blade. Focus on dodging the werewolf’s attacks and riposting with your silver blade or magic spells. Running from a werewolf is inadvisable—they are very quick and can track you through the harshest conditions by smell alone. If a friend has been afflicted with lycanthropy, it’s a good idea to tie them up at night until you can lift the curse.

While it can be difficult to determine what actions led to any one case of lycanthropy, you can narrow it down. Lycanthropy is often a punishment for violent, beastial actions. Lifting the curse usually requires great pain and or personal loss.

|Becoming a Werewolf|||
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
A character afflicted with Lycanthropy has a 30% chance of changing into a werewolf every night, when the moon rises. In their werewolf form, they are a vicious predator with a human’s cunning and an urge to kill. If the character is a player character, they are taken over by the GM until the sun rises. While in their beast state the lycanthrope has all of the werewolf’s weapons, armor, and abilities. The character also adds a bonus to four of their statistics.||
