>|**Electricity Vulnerability** Golems are vulnerable to electricity, which may dis- rupt them. If they take more than 10 points of damage, they must roll a Stun save under 7.|
>|**Dimeritium Bombs** When struck by a dimeritium bomb a golem becomes disrupted and sluggish. They are incapable of using their crushing force or charge and take a -2 to all stats for the duration of the bomb.|

>|Abilities|
>|:---:|
>|**Crushing Force** Due to the incredible force with which they punch, a golem cannot be parried and does double ablation damage to weapons, shields, or armor.|
>|**Charge** If a target moves more than 10m away from the golem, it can take a full round to charge and make a powerful attack at -4 which does 10d6 damage and knocks the target back 8m. If they strike anything while flying back, the target takes appropriate ramming damage as if from a [[horse]].|
>|**Constructed** A golem is immune to bleeding, poison, fire, or spells that affect the mind or emotions. They also cannot be reasoned with and never run out of STA.|
>|**Resistances** Golems only take half damage from piercing & slashing.|

## Common Superstition (Education DC:16)
```ad-quote
Golems are the only man-made monster out there. Folk say they’re made with the power of the elements and brought to life by the souls of the dead. Heh, seems pretty far-fetched to me since necromancy’s illegal all over the Continent, but who knows? What I do know is there’s no stoppin’ a golem on the loose without a witcher or a whole garrison. Folk say a chargin’ golem can run right through a house and out the other side, not even going through the door.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:14)
Golems are incredibly simple monsters that are nonetheless incredibly dangerous. Your average golem was created by a mage for defense or manual labor, or perhaps to guard something important. A golem takes its orders and follows them to the letter. Forever. A golem told to guard a vase will do so until it dies, which may be centuries (or even millennia) later. This also means a golem told to fetch water from a well will continue to fetch bucket after bucket until it is told to stop. Golems aren’t creative, but they are very persistent. You face a golem for one of three reasons. Reason one: you need something that a powerful mage doesn’t want you to get. In this case at least the golem is stationary–you’ll have time to plan ahead and prepare. Reason two: you are attacking a mage and said mage has a golem. Once again, at least you’ll have time to plan ahead. Reason three: a mage has created a golem specifically to kill you. This is the worst case. It will chase you ‘til the day you die, and probably dig up your corpse to check that you’re really dead. It might even give your corpse a few bone-shatter- ing punches just to make sure.

If you have to fight a golem, stock up on dimeritium bombs. While they won’t ‘shut off ’ a golem, they will make it sluggish. Elementa oil is also good, as are spells that incorporate electricity. When struck by enough electricity a golem will freeze up as its magical bonds try to reassert themselves. Never block or parry a golem–their fists are so strong that they stand a good chance of shattering any weapon. Since they’re con- structs you can also forget bleeding wounds, poison, mind-affecting spells, or fire. Lastly but possibly most important, if you see a golem charging at you...don’t be what it hits.
