## Common Opinion (Education DC:12)
```ad-quote
Mages, or magicians if ya wanna be respectful, are a pretty interestin’ case. Heh, they’re mutants I guess, though never say that to one or they’ll blow ya to hell. They can tap into the forces of magic and use that magic to cast spells. That’s about the extent of the common whoreson’s knowledge. From there it’s bedtime tales and legends. Heh, witches who steal children and experiment on ‘em in laboratories. Ungodly necromancers who raise the dead and’ll summon demons to take over your body. There are few places in the world that people still respect mages these days. A real shame. Few years ago mages were the most respected folk in the land.

## Academic Knowledge (Education DC:16)
It’s not very likely that you’ll ever fight a mage. Most of them are reasonably peaceful people who are more likely to hire a mercenary or an assassin to kill you. However, if you do wind up fighting a mage—to escape an experiment, stop a crime, or just because you feel like it—know that distance is not your friend. At range, a mage can throw a tremendous amount of power at you. Close range combat is a far better bet. Most mages practice less at melee combat then they do at spell casting. Their melee weapons are also less damaging and more prone to breaking. Keeping in melee range with a mage takes work—they are prone to teleport if you get too close to them.

The first thing you should do when fighting a mage is disarm them or destroy their staff. Without a staff a mage expends more energy per spell and wears out much faster. A mage drained of magic must damage their body to cast more spells or else take a turn to rest. That’s your best opportunity. Mages rarely wear armor, so killing an exhausted mage doesn’t take much. Since mages are usually very intelligent, they typically realize when they are beat and give up. However, if you shame a mage enough the mage will fight until the end. Mages prefer life in large cities, but with the Witch Hunts you may also run into one who’s hiding out.
