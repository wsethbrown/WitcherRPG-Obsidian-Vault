## Common Opinion (Education DC:10)
```ad-quote
Bein’ a ‘loyal dwarf’ I got some feelin’s about the Scoia’tael. They’d probably call me a dog of the humans. But I’d rather be a loyal dog than a rabid bitch runnin’ to its own damn death. Scoia’tael used to have a point. Heh, used to be they were fightin’ for freedom for the Northern elder races. Now they’re just revenge-driven madmen who’re lookin’ to go out in a blaze of glory and kill as many humans as they can before they die. You’ll find the last Scoia’tael— mostly elves—in the woods, hidin’ in caves, and settin’ ambushes for traveling merchants and military caravans. If you’re human, get ready for a fight.

## Academic Knowledge (Education DC:10)

Scoia’tael can be difficult to fight. They rarely rush at you and attack randomly. Being trained as guerilla fighters, Scoia’tael travel in groups called ‘commandos’ and lay am- bushes for their prey. When traveling through dense wilderness in the North, always keep an eye out in the trees and bushes. Oftentimes Scoia’tael commandos will track prey for a few hours until they come to a good ambush spot.

When they do attack, Scoia’tael will usually begin their ambush with a barrage of arrows from the forest line. With the first barrage fired, half of the unit will switch to their falchions and charge, sometimes screaming a battle cry such as “Aelirenn!” or “Shaerrawedd!”, that calls back to the great elven hero Aelirenn and the place of her death, Shaerrawedd Palace. While the melee group engages you, the other half of the commando will stay back, firing into the melee. Scoia’tael who are too far for melee and within 10m or so will often throw knives at the nearest target. The best way to fight Scoia’tael archers is to have cover. If you have a cart or caravan, get behind it (or better yet inside it) and force them to come to you. Try your best to stay out of the archer’s line of sight and deal with the melee fighters first. Negotiation is not advised.
