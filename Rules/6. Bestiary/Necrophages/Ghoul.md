## Common Superstition (Education DC:14)
```ad-quote
Ya see a lot of ghouls in the North these days. Heh, I remember when you could go your whole life without spottin’ one. But with all the corpses rottin’ in the fields and all the blood spillin’ in rivers and valleys, ghouls are croppin’ up all over. Most people assume they’re corpses, mutated and re-animated by magic into beasts. Rotten fiends that feed on the dead and attack just about anyone who comes near. Travel in packs and attack like wolves, circlin’ their prey, all attackin’ and keepin’ the target off kilter.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:10)
Much like other necrophages, common folk assume ghouls are re-animated corpses. They are actually of a species from another dimension that acts much like other animals. Ghouls are scavengers who feed on corpses left behind at battlefields, though they will attack fresh prey if it wanders by. You’ll usually find ghouls in small packs that often fight over food once danger has passed. When fighting ghouls, always watch your back. They will attack together and try to surround you, staggering their attacks to flank you and darting back. Single one ghoul out and attack it exclusively, to shave down the number of ghouls at- tacking. Keep in mind that ghouls can pounce from 5m away. Small chasms, short walls and the like are much less effective against ghouls than their slower necrophage brethren. When in melee combat, a ghoul strikes with its claws, but if it grapples a target (or the target is otherwise hindered) it may bite the target to cause a bleeding wound.

If you knock a ghoul below 10 Health Points, it will enter a fury. In this fury the ghoul attacks rabidly and its wounds quickly close. Kill the ghoul quickly to keep it from regenerating its health. It’s also vital to reposition often so the ghouls can’t gang up on you and get bonuses to attack. If you are fighting as a party, stand back to back so the ghouls can’t easily get into your back arc. 

If you need to lure a group of ghouls out of an area, it’s best to start by exhuming any buried bodies. Once exhumed, the bodies should be moved to draw the ghouls away.
