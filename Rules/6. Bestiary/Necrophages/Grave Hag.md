>|**Skull Circle** A grave hag can take 1 hour to make a skull circle. If they are within 100m of their skull circle they get +3 to all actions.|
>|**Command the Undead** Instead of attacking, a grave hag can give a command to each necrophage within 20m. The necrophages will carry out this order instead of acting normally. The order cannot be more complex than ‘grab that thing and bring it here’ or ‘go there and wait’.|

## Common Superstition (Education DC:18)
```ad-quote
Honestly your average son of a bitch doesn’t know much about grave hags. Heh, they’re night- mares smart enough to talk, set traps, and lure children away. Once heard that hags are what happens when a mage loses control. Heh, doubt that, but I guess...who knows. Grave hags are one of the few monsters I’ve ever heard of that could use magic. Or at least somethin’ like it.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:14)
Grave hags are one of the few fully sentient necrophages, which makes them very dangerous. Grave hags have nothing to do with mages. Though they have magic, grave hags are just another necrophage race from the Conjunction of the Spheres. Interestingly enough, grave hags appear exclusively female—a male hag has never been seen. Most books state that grave hags, like some other monsters, steal little girls from villages to transform into new hags. A few, though, suggest that grave hags are not actually female as such, but hermaphroditic.

What we do know is that grave hags are ambush predators that live near graveyards and other sources of rot- ten corpses. They are perfectly content to eat carrion, but will attack fresh prey if given the chance. When on the attack a grave hag will close the distance at tremendous speed and at- tack with its scything claws. If the target falls back to recover, the grave hag will use its poisonous tongue like a barbed whip to weaken the prey. The grave hag’s tongue can be sliced off with a successful parry with a bladed weapon. The safest ways to engage a grave hag are to keep distance or stock up on necrophage oil and get in close with a shielding spell or the Quen Sign. Grave hags can be reasoned with, but are incredibly stubborn and prone to attack immediately. If you must fight a grave hag in its home, check first for a magical skull circle or other necrophages it’s bent to its will. Deal with them first if you can.
