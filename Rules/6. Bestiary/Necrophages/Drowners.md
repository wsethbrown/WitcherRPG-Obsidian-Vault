## Common Opinion (Education DC:14)
```ad-quote
Common folk don’t know much about drowners. Old wives’ tales say when an evil enough son of a bitch bites it and their corpse winds up in a river or lake they come back as a drowner. Drowners’re mindless beasts that live to drown unlucky bastards and feed on their corpses. They ain’t the most dangerous beast in the world, but they gang up on ya. If ya see one drown- er there’s probably another two or three hidin’ in the water.

## WITCHER KNOWLEDGE (WITCHER TRAINING DC:10)

Drowners are actually not resurrected evildoers. Most people think so, thanks to folk stories and popular books on the subject of monsters. Drowners, like all necrophages, are creatures from another plane that came into this realm during the Conjunction of the Spheres many centuries ago. With no ecological niche here, they have become a plague upon the land. Drowners prefer coastline, rivers, and marshy areas. They are amphibious and spend most of their time in the water. When they do come out it is usually to follow their stomachs: to grab something close to the water’s edge or search for food on land. When they find some- thing to eat, they leap on it in a flurry of claws, attacking as a group and surrounding their prey.

A large group of drowners can be hellish to deal with. They overwhelm a single person by attacking in force and from all directions. They are immune to poison due to the horrible, murky, and toxic waters that they are used to, and it takes quite a bit to discourage them. However, they are also tremendously, staggeringly dumb. The few studies of drowners agree that they are about as intelligent as a predatory fish. They act completely on instinct, cannot in any way be reasoned with, and are even immune to spells that would mentally or emotionally affect them. This does mean that they never formulate plans more complex than ‘attack’ and they can be distracted by sufficiently shiny things as long as they haven’t tasted blood. Drowners are also highly susceptible to fire—it’s your best weapon. Being tremendously dumb, a drowner will continue to fight while on fire and will not try to put itself out until almost dead (below 10 HP).
