>># Humanoids
>>![[humanoids.svg|cover hsmall]]
>>Humanoids are not technically monsters. They include humans, as well as elves, dwarves, and other elderfolk. Humanoids are incredibly varied in their habitats and patterns. It’s important to remember that even in the standard rules for susceptibility, humanoids are not vulnerable to silver or resistant to steel.

>># Cursed Ones
>>![[cursed_ones.svg|cover hsmall]]
>>Cursed ones are humans or non-humans afflicted with a curse that transforms them into a monster. The most common cursed ones are werewolves. Since they are humans who were cursed, cursed ones normally prowl around human settlements. Most such cursed creatures are actively hostile against humans.

>># Necrophages
>>![[necorphage.svg|cover hsmall]]
>Necrophages are corpse eaters who frequent graveyards, battlefields, and deep caves. Their grisly appearance is misleading—they’re living extraplanar creatures. The less intelligent necrophages such as ghouls will attack anything that comes near. Cunning necrophages like hags will stalk grave- yards and lure away village folk.

>># Hybrids
>>![[hybrids.svg|cover hsmall]]
>Hybrid creatures include a myriad of chimeras such as sirens and griffins made up of an amalgamation of animal parts. Hybrids are incredibly varied and each prefer different habitats. Those that are capable of flight prefer high places, though hybrids can be found all over the world and in all environments.

>># Spectres
>>![[spectres.svg|cover hsmall]]
>Specters embody the powerful desires of the deceased. They usually come into existence when someone is murdered or dies in the throes of powerful emotion. While many seem to be intelligent, they are consumed with all-en- compassing drives—usually rage— that make them almost impossible to reason with.

>># Insectoids
>>![[insectoids.svg|cover hsmall]]
>Insectoids are enormous insects and arachnids that roam the wilderness, setting traps for passersby. Insectoids are generally ambush predators who prefer to leap out at their prey and strike them with poisoned fangs or claws. Wandering too close to an insectoid hive can lead to swarms of monsters coming after you.

>># Beasts
>>![[beasts.svg|cover hsmall]]
>Beasts, like humanoids, aren’t technically considered monsters. The category includes dogs, wolves, and the like. These creatures are not vulnerable to silver or resistant to steel. However they’re ubiquitous, found all over the deep wilderness and near settlements, preying on the townsfolk and livestock.
>
>># Elementa
>>![[elementa.svg|cover hsmall]]
>Elementa are fascinating creations of elemental magic: golems, elementals, gargoyles, and the like. Most such creatures are summoned by a mage or priest. They follow orders and have little will of their own. However when brought into this world without shack- les, elementa are forces of chaos that can destroy cities.
>
>># Relicts
>>![[relicts.svg|cover hsmall]]
>>Relicts are forces of nature that come into existence in wilderness areas over time. Possibly these monsters came into our realm with the Conjunction of the Spheres. They are all magical creatures with strong ties to the natural world. Relicts range in mentality from cunning and intelligent to primal and monstrous.
>
>># Ogroids
>>![[ogroids.svg|cover hsmall]]
>>Ogroids, including trolls, nekkers, and giants, are very humanoid creatures, often with almost human-level intelligence. Most are large and bulky (nekkers are the exception) and they not only form basic tribal societies but also, in the case of trolls, can speak human and elderfolk languages with difficulty.
>
>># Draconids
>>![[draconids.svg|cover hsmall]]
>>Draconids include creatures like wyverns and dragons. Most such Draconids are large, winged reptiles who are very dangerous (especially in melee combat) but feral. True dragons are as or more intelligent that humans and possess many more abilities. Draconids lair primarily in high places and mountains.
>
>># Vampires
>>![[vampires.svg|cover hsmall]]
>Vampires are an incredibly varied classification of blood-drinking monsters. Vampires usually hunt in ruins, though powerful vampires can thrive in cities. Lesser vampires are mindless beasts who tear bodies apart and then slurp up the blood. Higher vampires can blend in seamlessly with humans and wield tremendous power.
