## Common Superstition (Education DC:18)
```ad-quote
Now, not many folks even know these whoresons exist. Heh, mostly stick to the mountains from what I hear. What people do say’s pretty interestin’ though. These beasts are devils of ill intent and they feed on the evil thoughts of men. If ya encounter one it’ll put ya into a deep trance and feed on your darkest secrets. After it drains your mind dry it’ll tear ya limb from limb and feast on your corpse. Heh, if ya wanna stay safe, ya gotta make an evil eye pendant outta glass and ink. That’ll absorb the beast’s fell magics and whatnot.

## Witcher Knowledge (Witcher Training DC:18)
Fiends are among the most dangerous relicts you can encounter on the Continent. They are tremendous elk-like creatures, so large that even the most powerful Griffin School witcher couldn’t stagger them with the Aard Sign. When charging with their massive antlers it’s best to leap out of the way–nothing short of a stone wall will stop them. The beasts pose a tremendous threat, since not only are they tremendously strong, they heal almost as you cut them and can hypnotize with a look. Contrary to the common superstition an evil eye pendant will not protect you from a fiend’s hypnosis, which plunges you into a world of darkness where all you can see is the fiend‘s glowing third eye.

At this point it will charge, aiming to spear you on its antlers. Fiends are not demons, but relicts. There is some debate as to their intelligence since they appear to be related to the very smart and crafty succubi. However, fiends appear about as intelligent as your average bear and never act with complex reasoning. When fighting a fiend, stay light on your feet and dodge it. While you can block and parry, it is more advisable to keep maneuvering around the fiend. Relict oil can be tremendously useful when fighting a fiend, as well as moondust bombs to keep it from regenerating for a time and dimeritium bombs to stop the fiend’s hypnosis. Fiends also have incredibly sensitive hearing–loud noises such as banging on a shield or the explosion of bombs can stagger them.
