## Common Superstition (Education DC:8)
```ad-quote
Not much to be said about wolves. Heh, they’re bloody bastards that live in the woods and stalk travelers. They’ll usually only attack in packs of five or six and fire’ll make ‘em back off. If ya have to fight ‘em, make sure they can’t circle around ya—they’ll box ya in and attack from all directions. Terrible way to go if ya ask me. ‘Specially bad since the war’s been on. With all the corpses and wounded travelers, wolves are gettin’ braver and braver. Have ‘em in towns, pickin’ off infants in no time. Heh, lotsa folk think they’re a poor omen too. Can’t count the number of prophecies and whatnot that start with a wolf. Let me tell ya, none of ‘em are good.

## Knowledge of Wargs (Witcher Training DC:10)
While there are many strange stories and myths based around wolves, everyone can generally agree they aren’t magical creatures. Wargs, on the other hand, are even more shrouded in mystery for the vast majority of the populace. When a wolf pack gets large enough, or controls enough territory, you’ll eventually spot a warg among them. The warg is a large, bulky wolf (usually adorned with coarse brown fur) who becomes the leader of a pack. Even studied witchers aren’t sure whether one of the wolves transforms into a warg or whether large groups of wolves eventually draw a warg, but their existence is irrefutable.

While wargs appear to function like regular wolves, they have gained an eerie reputation for their bright red eyes and cunning minds. When facing a wolf pack lead by a warg, remember to single out the warg as quickly as possible. With the warg alive, the pack can operate as one unit and is capable of greater strategy than normal. Wargs command their brethren to circle around prey, attack specific targets to weaken a group, and even hinder more dangerous targets so the warg can score a killing blow more easily. The warg will often stay towards the back of a pack until its prey has been weakened, so for the most part ranged attacks will be your best bet. Silver is ineffective on wargs but a good old-fashioned steel weapon will do the trick. With an application of beast oil, killing the warg shouldn’t be tremendously difficult. Always keep in mind—a warg is just a big, tough wolf.

Wargs are larger than average wolves, with reddish-brown fur and bright red eyes. The way they prowl makes them seem much cleverer than the average wolf.||||
