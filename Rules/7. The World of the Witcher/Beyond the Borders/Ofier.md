Ofier is a largely unknown land across the Great Ocean. We believe several nations live out on an enormous plain, and as such love their horses, value them highly, and race them constantly. They are even said to have a variety with black and white stripes. In battle they carry a saber, a thin, curved sword, and a big, brass shield. Itâ€™s said that they show remarkable tolerance to other cultures. We know that Ofier trades with parties in Redania, as occasional Ofieri ships come to Novigrad. They trade in weapons, fine embroidered clothing, and luxury goods like incense and brass or gold jewelry. They do not trade in their horses, which are high strung and would never survive a sea voyage. I once heard of a scuffle when a prince of Ofier came to Redania to marry a noble woman, no doubt to seal a trade deal, but information about this is hard to find. Such a lucrative trade monopoly is well worth protecting. A few expeditions have sailed off to look for Ofier, but they have not returned. Whether this is because they perished or be- cause they prefer Ofier is not known.
