Up to now we’ve been dealing with what most consider “the Known World”. But explorers and merchants have long known that there are more lands, even though they are an exotic mystery.

To the west is the Great Sea. We know that across the sea lies Ofier. The North some- times has trade dealings with Ofier but I’ve never hear of anyone going there. I include more details later.

Along the fjords of the Great Sea north of Redania are the small kingdoms of the Dragon Mountains. On the north side of Redania and Kaedwen we know of Kovir and Poviss and the Hengfor’s League, but there is vast unknown and unmapped territory beyond them called the Far North.

To the south lies the Empire of Nilfgaard. We do not know how far south it ex- tends or what is on the other side. Hopefully some day, in peaceful times, we may trade in- formation with the Nilfgaardian Academy to fill in our knowledge.

To the east are the Blue Mountains that form the eastern border of Kaedwen. East of the Blue Mountains are impassable swamps filled with a plethora of monsters, and diseases in abundance. South of them the Tir Tochair range forms the eastern boundary of the Nilfgaardian provinces. These provide a secure boundary, but not as effective as what’s on the other side. The Great Korath Desert lies in the rain shadow of the Tir Tochair Mountains. They say that no rain ever falls in the Korath, also called the Frying Pan. It is a flat brown land with no plants or life beyond giant scorpions and ant lions. There is rumor of long-abandoned buildings in the wastes, but I have no evidence of this. Beyond the Tir To- chair and the Korath lie the mysterious lands of Hakland and Zerrikania.

># The Far North 
>North of Kovir and Poviss, north of the Hengfors League, beyond the Dragon Mountains, is the Far North. It is tundra and deep forests, mostly impossible to cultivate. Old tales speak of white dragons in the North, presumably from the Dragon Mountains. And yet we know of people there. Animals carved of bone or ivory sometimes show up in Kovir and Poviss. Some believe them to be of religious significance, perhaps representing “sacrifices” to ensure plentiful hunting.
