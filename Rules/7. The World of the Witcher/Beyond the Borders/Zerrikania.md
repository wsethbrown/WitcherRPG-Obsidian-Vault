Zerrikania is a little-known land to the southeast, beyond the great and terrible Korath Desert. Day-to-day goods show up in our markets sometimes, probably through a long chain of trade. They are said to worship a legendary gold dragon named Zerrikanterment, with scales that glimmer like the ocean at sunset. A queen rules this land, and her tattooed warrior women learn to fight from birth. They carry Zerrikanian sabers and recurved zefhar bows made of polished antelope horn. Zerrikania has many great alchemists as well, and bomb-making is a specialty. Zerrikanian fire scorpions, the Nilfgaardian siege pieces that even now hurl green fire into Vizima use designs and alchemy that came from Zerrikania.

Their land is hot, and animals we only see in traveling menageries, like tigers, roam the countryside. More fearsome are the creeping things, like giant spiders who prey on elephants and a fly which lays an egg in your head so that newly hatched larvae can feed on your brain.
