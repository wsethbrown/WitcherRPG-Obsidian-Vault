Cidaris acts as a blockade to Nilfgaardian sea power. It is a coastal country north of Verden, a nation of rough-and-tumble seafarers, independent and ready for a fight. Cidaris is ruled by King Ethain from his capital of Cidaris, which is built on elvish ruins. He is a wise king, a good strategist, a lover of art and artists, and a little bit of a pirate. The court is well known for culture, and the best performers visit often, including the well-known bard, Dandelion. Bremervoord is a small seaport city- state, a vassal of Cidaris. It is ruled by Duke Agloval, whose wife was once a mermaid, if you believe the balladeers. The Bremervoord cutlass is the favored weapon of pirates. Cidaris has a long history of resisting Skellige pirates, and has a fair number of pirates of its own. Its army contributed greatly at the battle of Brenna in the First Nilfgaardian War and they are now cooperating with Skellige. Nilfgaardian ships must run a gaunt- let between Skellige and Cidaris or chance deeper, more dangerous waters to get to the North.
