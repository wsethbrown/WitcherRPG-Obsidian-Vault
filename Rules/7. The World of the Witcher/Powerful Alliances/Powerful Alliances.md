># Border Crossing
>Once had to cross the border from Kaedwen to Redania. Up along the Kestrels there was a little road with a toll collector on each side. One Redanian, sportin’ the Redanian eagle and the pyre of the Eternal Flame, the other Kaedweni, with that damn unicorn and the crossed lightning bolts of Kreve on his sword guard. Turns out I was on a major trade route through the Kestrels that each side wanted to make some coin off of. Managed to scarper out of there when they both drew steel on each other, heh.

In a war, those who participate are warriors. Those who don’t are victims. They live lives of perpetual fear and uncertainty. You feel safe in your homeland? What happens when the war front rolls through your town? To avoid the uncertainty and protect their interests, some join alliances separate from the royal armies.

Joining an alliance can be easy or hard. To be a witcher you just have to be a male child at the right place (or wrong place, depending on your outlook) at the right time. But in the case of the Scoia’tael or the Crescent Moon, you have to find your alliance and then get through whatever initiation they use to make sure you’re not a spy.

Alliances offer advantages. Witchers are faster, stronger, and heal better than regular humans. Not only do mages have spells, but people’s fear of mages means instant respect. In the Scoia’tael you gain a group of fearless allies around you who won’t let you down, or let you hang—better treasure than gold.

But there’s always a price. The witch- er’s cat’s eyes which allow you to see in the dark also give you away to superstitious vil- lagers who think all witchers are themselves monsters. Mage Hunters with their dimeritium shackles earn the aid of villagers, but they are target number one for any mage in town. You can get rich as a Havekar, but one of your lot may get jealous, or a commando may decide they don’t feel like paying you, or an army may catch up to you and you’ll dance on the gibbet. Regardless, being part of an alliance gives you power but can kill you just as quickly.
