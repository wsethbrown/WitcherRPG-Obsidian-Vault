The Wolf Keep, Kaer Morhen, is hidden in the Blue Mountains in Kaedwen. These are the witchers we hear the most about. They fight with swords, with strong blows appropriate for monster killers. I have heard that there are only four or five of them left. The legendary Geralt of Rivia is a Wolf witcher. The tales of his exploits have grown so fantastic that many of them may be just the artistic imagination of the bards, who make large sums of money from them. A riot of townspeople badly damaged their keep and killed many of the witchers.
