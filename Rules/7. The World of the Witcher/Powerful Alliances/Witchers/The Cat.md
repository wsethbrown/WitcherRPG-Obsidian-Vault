The Cats are probably what first made the people distrust and hate witchers. Their method of creating witchers was different from other schools and the results were often unstable and bloodthirsty. They didnâ€™t have a keep, but travelled in a caravan, Dyn Marv. The Cat fighting style is light and quick, developed from elven styles. They may not even be considered witchers any more. The Cats adjusted to the poor market for monster slayers by becoming assassins of men. Their presence only reinforces the fear and anger of the people. It is not clear if there are any Cat witchers left, and it appears that their caravan has disbanded.
