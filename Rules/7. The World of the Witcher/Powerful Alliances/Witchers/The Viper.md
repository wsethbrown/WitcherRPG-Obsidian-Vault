The Viper Keep, Gorthvr Gvaed, is said to be in the Tir Tochairs close to Nilfgaard. Their fighting style features sinuous, unpredictable movements and they often carry two smaller blades, or “fangs,” which are often poisoned. They are perhaps the most alien and secretive of witchers. After the Usurpator tried unsuccessfully to absorb the Vipers, the Nilfgaardian army destroyed their keep and the Vipers dispersed. Letho of Gulet attempted to win back Nilfgaardian favor for the Vipers by working for Emhyr var Emreis.
