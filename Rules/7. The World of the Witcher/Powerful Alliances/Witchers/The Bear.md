The Bear Keep, Haern Cadvch, was a fortress in the Amell Mountains. They wore heavy armor more flexible than plate. They may have had an understanding with the dwarves and gnomes of the Amell Mountains. As one would expect, the Bears were terrible to fight, with amazing strength and endurance, but when the Bears repeatedly failed in a contract to destroy a cabal of vampires, the frustrations of the people in the war-torn provinces around them boiled over into riots. It is believed that the Bear Keep still stands somewhere in the mountains.
