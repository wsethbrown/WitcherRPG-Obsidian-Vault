The Gryphon Keep, Kaer y Seren, was in the North on the sea end of the Dragon Mountains. The other schools respected the Gryphons for their study of magic and fighting style that emphasized multiple opponents. Gryphon scholarship enhanced the existing witcher signs. Unfortunately the Gryphon School was badly damaged in an avalanche, killing many of the witchers. Rumor has it that a group of mages became angry when the Gryphons refused to share important books of magic in their library, and caused the avalanche in revenge.
