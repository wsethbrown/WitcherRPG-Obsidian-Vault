Dol Blathanna, “the Valley of Flowers” in Elder Speech, is otherwise called the Edge of the World, where the valley rolls up to the Blue Mountains. Up until 100 years ago this was the beloved mother realm of the Aen Seidhe. When the humans came to Dol Blathanna, they recognized the amazing quality of the land—it grew any seed they planted, and lushly. They drove the Aen Seidhe into the harsh, rocky peaks of the Blue Mountains and soon the straight lines of human agriculture reshaped the valley. Dol Blathanna’s rich land and plentiful animal life allowed the Aen Seidhe to live comfortably as hunter-gatherers. The peaks of the Blue Mountains were nowhere near as bountiful, and the retreating Aen Seidhe lived desperate lives. It seemed only a matter of time before the Aen Seidhe starved or desperately attacked the humans.

># The Last Refuge 
>Elves’ve never been good at integratin’. Or gettin’ along with just about anybody. Heh, we dwarves dealt with ‘em and they didn’t bug the gnomes too much. But...oh boy...long and the short of it is, us dwarves can mix in with the humans in their cities and do pretty well for ourselves. Ain’t gonna lie, it ain’t always easy, but we try harder than the elves, I’d say. By now, Dol Blathanna’s the last refuge of elven culture and, hell, probably the whole species in the North. They don’t have to fight to survive or worry about their neighbors rapin’ their daughters and hangin’ ‘em in the night. Problem is, it ain’t a lotta space, barely the size of Kovir from what I hear. I can’t say I know what’ll happen in the next few years but I can’t imagine race relations between the humans and the elves are gonna get any better.

During the second Nilfgaardian War, Nilfgaard made an agreement with the elves; Nilfgaard would support an elvish homeland in Dol Blathanna but the price was that the Scoia’tael must remain on the offensive harrying the Northern forces. During the Peace of Cintra negotiations their status was negotiated away and they became a duchy of Aedirn, but without paying tribute. Nilfgaard also agreed to hand over many Scoia’tael officers who were then executed by the North. Also, humans previously living in Dol Blathanna were to be accepted back onto their land in the valley, with resources evenly divided between humans and elves. But humans pulling out of the valley had destroyed everything, even as the Aen Seidhe had done when retreating from their cities, so elves and humans will have to rebuild together. The sorceress Francesca Findabair, known in Elder Speech as Enid an Gleanna (Daisy of the Fields) and also held to be the most beautiful woman in the world, was made queen of the new nation of Dol Blathanna. She is advised by Filavandrel of the World’s Edge, leader of the Blue Mountain elves. It is said that Dana Meadbh, the elvish nature goddess has been seen in the valley from time to time, taking different forms. If she is there, we have no word of her taking action for the elves or against the humans beyond her care and maintenance of the valley itself. She most often appears in her radiant goddess form in the summer, accompanied by a young stag and a large hedgehog. Despite the comparative peace of Dol Blathanna, only a handful of elven children have been born there since the Peace of Cintra.
