By the middle of 1226, Fergus had incorporated Etolia and Vicovaro. It is no mistake that he chose these two first. Western Gemmera is steppeland, but Eastern Gemmera fades into arid, rocky hills. These harsh surroundings breed harsh warriors, miners, and bandits. It was only after Fergus had the resources and staging areas of Etolia and Vicovaro that he was ready to take on Gemmera. All Nilfgaard was really interested in were warriors and Gemmeraâ€™s mines, whose large seams of dimeritium are the only known Southern source. Nilfgaardian troops rooted out the population in Eastern Gemmera, in some areas leaving little more than a few wandering goat herders. The fiercest of the Gemmerians joined the Nilfgaardian army for loot and mayhem. They wield a sword called the torrwr that stands almost 2 meters at the guard, appropriate for the towering Gemmerians them- selves. Gemmerian units have twice as many Nilfgaardian officers as other provincial units, and it is not a desired posting. There are no large cities in Gemmera, only well-established dirt roads that take you to a chain of villages.
