Two thirds of Mettina is the Mag Deira Plain. Mettinese children are practically born in the saddle. Expansive ranches raising cattle and Mettinese ponies are common. The Mettinese pony is usually white and is extremely hardy, sure-footed, and intelligent. It is believed that the original stock came from the Velda River Delta be- tween Mettina and Gheso. Here the Markee, or Velda Delta horsemen, live rough all year round minding the herds of horses that roam the delta. This life also makes the Markee proud and tough cavalrymen. That delta is also the site of many wineries. The best known is Mettina Rose. It is approachable—some might say “table wine.” It is drunk throughout the provinces. Mettinese people are extremely proud of their wine; should wine-lovers from Touissant pass through it is likely their wine discus- sion would devolve into a shouting match, or even a duel. Mettina’s king pays tribute to Nilfgaard, often in the form of horses and horsemen.
