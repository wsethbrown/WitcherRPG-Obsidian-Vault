Etolia lies on the north bank of the Alba, which also flows through the Nilfgaardian capital, allowing easy access. It has many favorable features including access to two major river systems and a sea coast. Life in pre-imperial Etolia was simple. People lived well. The king primarily wanted to live comfortably, and his people were the same. Trading, farming, fishing, and hand embroidery were their primary industries.

In 1216, Emperor Fergus var Emreis decided to expand Nilfgaard. Etolia might not have been his first choice, but it fit his purposes. Nilfgaard attacked Etolia, overwhelmed it, and made it an example. The Em- peror left no doubt about his goals and what he was willing to do to accomplish them. The structures that defined Etolian life were decimated and the spirit of the Etolian people was broken. In forty years there has not been one organized popular up- rising. Nilfgaard has created a new provincial government, but it is the government of an overlord. The Etolians are unique in their farming of white belly fish, a 5-7 kilogram fresh- water fish from the Alba.
