Vicovaro lies on the northern border of Nilfgaard and the south-eastern border of Etolia. Many of the nobles have large, defensible castles in the mountains of eastern Vicovaro. Nilfgaardian nobles took over some of these in their occupation. It also borders the Alba, but unlike Etolia, Vicovaro has a strong, intelligent nobility. When Emperor Fergus started to move and they saw what had happened to Etolia, Vicovaro graciously asked to join the Empire. All this al- lows the people to live plentiful, stable lives as long as they pay due re- spect to the nobles and to Nilfgaard. They educate their children and send the smartest and most socially adept to the Nilfgaardian Academy. It is no mistake that these young people re- turn home with a solid knowledge of Nilfgaardian etiquette and contacts in the Nilfgaardian nobility. This strategy allows Vicovaro to place many Vicovarians in not only the provincial government but the Nilfgaardian government. The Emperor’s seneschal is Vicovarian. Vicovaro has managed their own absorption and are still proud to say “I am Vicovarian.”
