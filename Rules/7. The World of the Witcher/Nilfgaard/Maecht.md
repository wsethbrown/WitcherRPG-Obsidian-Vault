Most people in Maecht live in the western forests and along the rivers. Despite the rocky and forbidding Tir Tochair mountains in the east, some traders established lucrative relations there with one of the last gnomish cities, deep in the Tir Tochair mountains, for exquisite artistic and mechanical crafts. Two years after the absorption of Ebbing, the Usurpator realized that he could not press further north with Maecht at his back. The battle was short. The Usurpator settled a puppet king on Maecht’s throne. The gnomes withdrew into their mountain holds to avoid being captured by Nilfgaard and forced to churn out Nilfgaardian weapons and armor. When the Usurpator was overthrown, the king was summoned to Nilfgaard for a private talk with Emhyr var Emreis. He has been very careful to toe the Nilfgaardian line since then. There are three underground resistance movements centered around the country’s princes. If they ever worked together, they might cause trouble.
