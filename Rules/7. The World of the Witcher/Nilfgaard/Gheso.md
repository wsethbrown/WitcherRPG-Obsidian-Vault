Seeing the inevitable coming, the Baron of Gheso surrendered to Nilfgaard—at least temporarily. When the small force arrived for occupation, the Baron thought he could dictate terms to the army. The town of Glyswen, or White River, is a good example of what happens when you try to dictate terms to Nilfgaard. All that was left was ten huts, part of a palisade, and an inn. The population was decimated and Nilfgaardian peasants were brought in to fill the space. The populace is afraid of Nilfgaardians, so the tasks a government might be responsible for have been taken over by feuding petty nobles and bandit kings. The roads are not safe in Gheso. Bandits and slavers roam freely, especially on what used to be called the “Velda Road” after the river it runs along, dividing Gheso from Maecht. It is now called “The Bandit’s Road.” It will take you to the town of Loredo, also known as “The Bandit’s Lair,” where all manner of folk from farmers to slavers can rest, resupply, and trade their booty. I have not been able to find a single reason why one might want to go to Gheso.
