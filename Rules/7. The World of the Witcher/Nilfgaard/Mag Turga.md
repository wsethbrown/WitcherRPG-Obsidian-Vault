Mag Turga is a small, isolated high- land between the Amell Mountains and the Tir Tochair. It is rugged and thickly forested, with dangerous monsters and crumbling cliffs. Be- cause of the constant supply of fuel, it is a good place to smelt the ore that comes from Belhaven in the north- east. It is near the Theodula Pass which allows one to cross from Nazair to Riverdell and the Slopes. Now they supply wood to the Nilfgaardian governments in Cintra, Nazair, and Angren, although not everyone is pleased about that. While Mag Turga’s isolation makes the people clannish and slow to warm to outsiders, rumors have arisen that dwarves are digging at the roots of their hills. Mag Turga was absorbed peacefully by the Empire and the Empire was glad of it. Battles through the deep forests and high cliffs would have cost a lot of time and lives. The iron smelters are primarily in the city of Tergano. It’s a grimy town but is the largest one in Mag Turga. As the loggers move farther into the forest they are running into areas thick with gi- ant spider-like arachasae, so wood prices are going up.
