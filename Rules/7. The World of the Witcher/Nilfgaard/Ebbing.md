In his initial advance, the Usurpator bypassed Maecht to attack Ebbing. Ebbing is an attractive target. It is a large, sparsely populated area, and richer than Maecht. The net of rivers in Ebbing creates marshy soil similar to Temeria’s. Land reclaimed from the swamp is rich and fertile. Nilfgaard took advantage of a succession crisis between Ebbing’s quadruplet heirs, where negotiations changed daily depending on what faction was in power. Finally the Usurpator lost patience and sent in the army. The Ebbing military was based on social status, not competence. They took horrible losses, except the nobles— who fled the field. The people were so tired of the continuing political chaos that they adapted to the situation. Ebbing hasn’t caused problems for Nilfgaard, so they are left largely alone. There is still a lot of corruption. A note for the traveler: you may wish to avoid Claremont. The town is known to stage pit fights for the amusement of organized criminals and depraved nobles. Rumors of aardvark pit fighting are not confirmed.
