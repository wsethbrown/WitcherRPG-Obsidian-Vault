Nazair was a beautiful land, much like Touissant. Some years ago, Duke Adam of Nazair decided to change the course of the Sansretour River, not keeping in mind that the river runs through countries other than Nazairâ€”in fact, not taking into consideration that that river runs through the Sansretour Valley, the most prized wine region in Nilfgaard. The result was that many vineyards and orchards turned into inhospitable bogs and swamps. More recently, Nilfgaard took the country in an unusually difficult battle. Since then there have been multiple up- risings, and the radical element still schemes in the taverns, wearing the blue rose of Nazair. This dazzling azure rose is found only in Nazair. Cuttings are in great demand and are often smuggled out of Nazair to be sold for outrageous prices. One of the most attractive places in Nazair is Lake Muredach. There are several beautiful summer homes of the nobility on the lake, most built to be defensible. One wonders what they had in mind. Nazairian ceramics are skillfully detailed and make reliable trade goods in large cities.
