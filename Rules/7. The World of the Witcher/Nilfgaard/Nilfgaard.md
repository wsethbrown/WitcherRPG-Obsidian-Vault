Emhyr var Emreis owns two thirds of the known world. It behooves our citizens to learn a little about his nation and culture, because if things go badly it could be your culture too.

># Slavery
>Slavery is legal in Nilfgaard, though indentured servitude is more prevalent, especially in the heart of the Empire. People convicted of minor crimes, debtors, and provincials taken prisoner may become indentured to a well-to-do family. They can be indentured for anything from two to ten years. The penalty for a servant who tries to escape is severe, so as to discourage rebellion.

The Nilfgaardian Emperor Fergus var Emreis was the first to make con- tact with the North and the one to expand the Kingdom of Nilfgaard into an empire. He believed deeply in expansion and add- ed three provinces to Nilfgaard during his reign: Etolia, Vicovaro, and Gemmera.

Nilfgaard has made it very clear: accept Nilfgaard and respect the Emperor, and all can be well. A cooperative country gains culture, education, protection, trade from far and wide—you may even be able to keep your royals. Oppose Nilfgaard and pay the penalty. Temeria and Southern Aedirn are examples. They are laid waste, and anything of value has been destroyed or hauled away. The very land itself is burned and scarred.

I digress here to speak of the Nilfgaardian military. The young men of noble family who come out of the Braibant Military Academy after four difficult years are always perfectly dressed and snap to atten-tion at the drop of a pin. They will go on to commands of their own, and the very best will be selected for the Impera Brigade, the Emperor’s personal guard and the special forces of the Empire. Then there are the Nilfgaardian regulars. They are trained to fight, and they do so without question. If a young man shows terrific potential he may be moved up to the top flight. He will be adopted by a military family and cut off all association with old friends. He is now of the military noble class and must learn all of its etiquette and politics.

Then there are the provincial armies. If Nilfgaardian troops are burning, raping, and looting randomly, you can be sure they are provincial troops: less trained, less disciplined, with a thinly stretched officer corps to control them.It is important to remember that these troops may be from a province only recently conquered and decimated by the Nilfgaardian army to which they now belong. You will want to stay away from Gemmerian troops at all cost. They are known to be mad dogs and sadists.

># Life in Nilfgaard
>Anyone born in Nilfgaard is a Nilfgaardian citizen. Citizens can vote and be in the Senate (although a senator is usually a noble or a scholar). There are elven and dwarven citizens that have businesses in Nilfgaard. Non-human races are treated better in Nilfgaard than here and are rarely killed in pogroms. Women may hold land or businesses in their own name. In the upper classes, marriages are still arranged and the nobility keeps its ranks closed. Some young women have attended the Academy (not the military academy but a scholarly academy of learning).

During the Usurpator’s reign—just before Emperor Emhyr and just after his father—Ebbing, Maecht, Mettina, Gheso, Mag Turga, and Nazair were all conquered by Nilfgaard. The Mettinese are probably the most like Nilfgaard. The Mettinese provincial army has its own officer corps. There are a lot of people from Gheso in the army, because enlisting gets one out of Gheso. Nazair is the biggest problem for Nilfgaard. Their underground anti-Nilfgaard faction is always planning something, and while ineffective, they are persistent.

Magic users in Nilfgaard are a different question. Anyone who shows signs of ability are sent to Gweision Haul, the Magic Academy. While there, they are overseen by the staff, and when they graduate they are watched by the Secret Service. Nilfgaard keeps mages on a very short leash.

The Emperor learned from his father’s overthrow, and to this day keeps a close eye on his nobles through his secret police. He is a gifted strategist and a great manipulator. He is a stern man. He dresses only in black, and always more plainly than anyone at court. At this time he holds most of Temeria as well as Aedirn, Verden, and Lyria and Rivia. We don’t know what will happen next.
