The Hengfors League was once the East March of Kovir. Since breaking away, that area has broken up into several small principalities: mainly Caingorn, Creyden, Malleore, and Woefield. Sandwiched between Redania and Kovir and Poviss, the League would have to cooperate or be annexed. After 200 years of war, King Niedamir of Caingorn finally united this group by military intervention, executing anyone who opposed him. The League are followers of the Cult of Kreve, the thunder god of the North. Kreve’s followers take action to fight evil in the world, but also within themselves. Originally, the Order of the White Rose was the military arm of Kreve, but they have evolved into the Order of the Eternal Flame. Knights of the Eternal Flame, who hunt down non-humans and mages, are discouraged from settling in the League due to their close association with King Radovid of Redania.

Many of the nobles have winter homes in eastern Malleore, now famous for its hot springs. Not being overly fond of hot springs himself, King Niedamir built a sumptuous winter home there for his brother-in-law Yogin Pieters, long thought to be the head of Neidamir’s secret police. Travelers to the often snowbound countries of the League say marvelous things about the Schmaltznudeln. It is apparently similar to the fried doughrings found in Oxenfurt.
