Verden has an unusual story. This long strip of land south of Kerack sits at the mouth of the mighty Yaruga River and has a long, welcoming sea-coast. It’s in a perfect place for trade, but for the Brokilon Forest on its eastern border. This impassable dryad forest so infuriated King Ervyll of Verden that he offered bounties for dryad scalps, earning the enmity of all non-humans. At the time of the Second Nilfgaardian War, King Ervyll broke from the North and signed a treaty with Nilfgaard. This was very unpopular in Verden, and Ervyll was overthrown by his son Prince Kistrin and later assassinated. Fortunately for Verden, the Nilfgaardian representatives there were notably inept. The opposition led by the now-King Kistrin in league with Skellige and Cintra forced Nilfgaard out of Verden. Unfortunately Verden has since been retaken. King Kistrin’s whereabouts are unknown.
