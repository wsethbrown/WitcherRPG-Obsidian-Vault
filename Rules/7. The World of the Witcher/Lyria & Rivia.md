The small country of Lyria and Rivia is an area between the southern Blue Mountains and the Mahakaman Mountains surrounding the cities of Lyria and Rivia. The summer court is in Lyria, the winter court in Rivia. Here you will find Dol Angra, one of the few good fords on the Yaruga. Before being captured by Nilfgaard it was ruled by Queen Meve, frequently called “a second Calanthe” after the powerful and beloved queen of Cintra. Currently, bands of Rivian guerilla fighters still stalk the forests. Rivians in particular are known as hardy souls and exceptionally skilled crossbowman, but they are also widely considered wild and unscrupulous. Although not born in Rivia, Geralt of Rivia was knighted by Meve for helping holding off Nilfgaardian forces at a critical moment in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga during the 2nd Nilfgaardian War. Ironically, Geralt also died in Rivia defending non-humans in a pogrom. I gather he was killed by a very ordinary man with a pitchfork, named Rob.
