500 years ago, the Nordlings arrived, in an event called the Landing of the Exiles. These were the humans destined to take over all of the North. They had cautious relations with the dwarves and gnomes, but relations with the elves became hostile. For a long time human settlement progressed rapidly. Territorial agreements and treaties with the elves were made and broken at the convenience of the humans. At first the elves believed that eventually the humans would stop expanding, but it never happened. Eventually the werebubbs and vran were forced back into a few small enclaves and the elves began to retreat, destroying their glorious cities behind them. But not all the elves were willing to resign themselves. A young elvish woman named Aelirenn led one last campaign against the humans. Many, many young elves were killed.

# Redania
Soon after the Landing, the four major countries of the North began to form. In Redania, Sambuk ruled an area including Novigrad and the Pontar Delta. The port and the river drove Redanian trade development. Eventually as the countries became larger, the Redanian trade empire bumped up against the Temerian trade empire across the Pontar, sometimes with volatile results.

Sambuk’s grandson Radovid I, also known as Radovid the Great, solidified the Redania we know today. Radovid despised his brother, Troydan, and suspected that he was scheming to take the throne. He gave his brother what should have been an hon- or title: dominion over the northern province of Kovir; a cruel joke, as the province of Kovir has eleven months of winter and August. Little did Radovid know that Kovir contained one of the largest gold deposits in the North and 70% of the world’s dimeritium. Kovir and Poviss are now the wealthiest countries in the North.

# Temeria
In Temeria, Dezmod became the first king at the time of the Landing. There are legends about short-lived kings between Dezmod and his son, Geddes, but at the ascension of Geddes we are on firmer ground. His first son was born to a mistress named Vinifrida, who it is said was a full-blooded elf. So it is possible that the Temerian royal line has some elf in it. The line has carried on un- broken until Foltest, giving Temeria marked stability.

># "King Abdank"
>Legend says that King Dezmod of Temeria was succeeded by a mentally deficient son, Abdank. During his rule, he was “advised” by the sorcerer Raffard the White, who turned down the crown but kept the power. They resolved the Six Year War, though little of that story has come down to us. It seems fairly certain that Raffard objected to the formation of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, and was killed. After his death, and a few years of Abdank fumbling along, the king died and a struggle ensued between Maribor and Ellander. Supposedly Adalbert of Maribor succeeded Abdank, and was succeeded by Geddes. This is an opportunity for some serious scholarship .

# Aedrin
Aedireen, the granddaughter of the first king of Aedirn, won a great deal of new territory through wars and negotiations. In the face of a possible attack by Redania, Aedireen made a treaty with the new nation of Kaedwen. The attack was repulsed and Aedirn claimed the Lormark or Upper Aedirn. But seizing this fantastically fertile land angered Kaedwen and has soured relations. Today Aedirn, the most sophisticated of the four preeminent countries, has been ripped apart by Nilfgaard.

# Kaedwen
The early people who went up the Pontar and turned left into the rocky, forest-covered mountains of Kaedwen must have been hardy stock. There is little arable land in Kaedwen, but the people love their land and pride themselves on being tough and resilient. They have many legends of their early kings, but their political history starts with King Benda, who helped negotiate the Treaty of Lan Exeter, ending the war between the forces of Redania and Kaedwen and those of Kovir, making Kovir and Poviss an independent nation. Benda’s grandson Henselt is a good military mind, but is more known for his intense loathing of non-humans.
