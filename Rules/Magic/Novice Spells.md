># Earth Spells
>For the purposes of magic, earth is used as a catch-all term for both the mineral form of earth and also natural and living things such as plants and animals.
>
># Maintaining Spells
>Spells which are active require maintaining: every round the mage must spend an amount of STA equal to the value next to active. The mage must focus on maintaining this spell and cannot cast other spells while they are maintaining an active spell.
>
># Telepathic Spying
>You can use Telepathy to silently listen to a target’s thoughts. This works the same as regular telepathy. If the target has a witcher medallion this will cause it to vibrate, and if the target is a mage and has Mag- ic Training, they get a chance each round to detect the telepathic spying by rolling Magic Training against your initial Telepathy roll.
