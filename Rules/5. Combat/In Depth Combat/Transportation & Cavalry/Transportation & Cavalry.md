## Control Rolls
When riding animals or driving vehicles you have to concern yourself with keeping control. Whenever you attempt a maneuver, you must make a Control check to keep your transportation under control:

`REF stat+Ride skill +Control Mod.+1d10`

This Control check must beat a DC appropriate to whatever maneuver you are trying to accomplish.
- Simple (15): Swerve a vehicle or jump a low obstacle on a horse.
-   Difficult (20): Control a skidding vehicle or make an abrupt stop.
-   Very Difficult (25): Jump a vehicle or leap a high obstacle on a horse.

## Control Modifiers
Each mode of transportation has its own control modifier. Add the value from the control modifier table to your Control rolls.

### Bareback Modifiers
When riding bareback (without a saddle of any form) you are at a -2 to all Control checks.

### Control Modifier
| Mount/Vehicle | Control Mod. |
|---------------|--------------|
| Horse         | 2            |
| War horse     | -2           |
| Mule          | 0            |
| Ox            | -2           |
| Sailboat      | -1           |
| Sailing ship  | -1           |
| Cutter        | 0            |
| Cart          | 0            |
| Carriage      | -1           |

## Control Loss
If you fail a Control check, you risk losing control completely and having horrible things happen to you and your mount/vehicle. If you are driving a vehicle, use the Vehicle Control Loss table. If you are on a mount, something happens to both you and the mount. Roll twice on the Mounted Control Loss table, once for the riders and once for the mount, to see what happens.

### Getting Out From Under a Horse
If your mount falls on top of you, you have two options: let it come to and get off you naturally or try to get out from under it. If someone can make a **Physique check with a DC of 25**, they can lift the horse off of you.
