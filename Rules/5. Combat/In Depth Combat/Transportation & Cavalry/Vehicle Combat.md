You can make all the usual attacks from the back of a mount or on a vehicle. You can also draw or stow weapons, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Each time you attack you must make a Control check.

## Charging and Ramming
When making a melee attack from the back of a mount or on a vehicle, you are essential- ly charging. You can also ram your vehicle into something, but for a vehicle pulled by animals that Control check is at a -10.

When charging you must still roll to hit: Weapon skill if attacking from horseback, and Ride or Sailing if ramming. If you hit, you do either normal weapon damage or ramming damage, but you add damage to both based on the speed of the charge. To calculate this extra damage, divide the number of meters between you and your target by 2, (rounded down and capped at 5). Add this number of d6s to your damage. If you are galloping on your horse, assume your number is 5. Then, multiply this extra damage by the appropriate modifier on the Weight Modifier table. In the case of a ramming vehicle, the full damage is done to your vehicle as well as the target.

## Vehicle Damage 
Each vehicle has Health Points much like a mount or character. When the vehicle runs out of HP, it collapses and cannot move.

## Falling
Falling damage is calculated similarly to ramming damage. When you fall from a height you divide the number of meters you fall by 2 and roll that many d6s to determine damage. Falling damage is done to the torso and it can be soaked by armor. If you collide with anything that thing also takes the damage you suffer.

You fall at a rate of approximately 30 meters per round. If you are near a ledge or something similar you can grab you can make an Athletics check (at a DC decided by the GM) to grab the edge. If you succeed you take damage equivalent to how far you have fallen to 
your arm.
