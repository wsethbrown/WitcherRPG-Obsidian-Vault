## Healing Over Time
Characters begin healing Health Points naturally over time if someone makes either a **DC:14 Healing Hands** or a **First Aid** roll for them. They regain a number of HP equal to their REC stat per day of rest. While resting, you must not do anything too strenuous. If you spend a lot of time running around, doing work, or fighting, you only heal half of your Recovery per day. If healed with a Healing Hands check you gain an extra 3 HP per day. Critical wounds heal differently.

### [[Healing Hands]] 
| Critical  | Turns | DC |
|-----------|-------|----|
| Simple    | 2     | 12 |
| Complex   | 4     | 14 |
| Difficult | 6     | 16 |
| Deadly    | 8     | 18 |

## Healing with Magic 
If you are traveling with (or can find) a mage or priest, they can heal you with magic. Magical healing is uncommon: most magic users are incapable of performing it. If you are a witcher, or mildly suicidal, you could take a witcher’s potion. For witchers this is perfectly safe. For non-witchers it can be like drinking poison.
- **Spells & Rituals:** A mage can cast a magical heal- ing spell on a target to regenerate their Health Points over time. A Ritual of Life restores health immediately on casting.
- **Potions**: Witchers and non-witchers can drink a swallow potion to gain health back, but non-witchers must make a DC:18 Endurance check or be poisoned instead of being healed.
  
### Healing Spell
| Critical  | Uses | DC |
|-----------|------|----|
| Simple    | 4    | 14 |
| Complex   | 6    | 16 |
| Difficult | 8    | 18 |
| Deadly    | 10   | 20 |

## Healing Critical Wounds 
Critical wounds require time and medical attention. A doctor can heal a critical wound by taking a number of rounds (specified by the Healing Hands table) and then making a Healing Hands roll that beats the DC specified for the severity of the wound. A mage must use the Healing spell a number of times (specified by the Healing Spell table) to heal a critical wound. The mage’s Healing spell does not regenerate Health Points and their Spell Casting roll must beat the DC listed for the severity of critical wound to count towards the number of uses.

After a critical wound has been treated by a doctor or a mage it must heal over time. Check your BODY stat and wound level on the Critical Healing table to see how many days you’ll need to get rid of the Treated penalty.
