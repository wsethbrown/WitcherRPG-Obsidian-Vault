## Melee Weapons

Melee weapons, the most prevalent in the world of the Witcher, rely on REF to hit. The formula for melee attacks is: `REF stat+Weapon skill +Modifier+1d10`

## Brawling & Wrestling
You may wind up in the midst of combat un- armed. In this case you’ll be brawling. Un- less marked differently, these attacks each take an action and replace fast or strong strikes. Brawling does non-lethal damage.
- Punch
- Kick
- Push Kick
- Charge
- Disarm
- Grapple
- Pin
- Choke
- Throw
- Trip

## Special Attacks 
Anyone can swing a sword. Real soldiers like to throw in special strikes for best effect. Unless marked otherwise, each special attack requires 1 action, replacing a normal attack action.
- Charge 
- Pommel Strike
- Disarm 
- Trip
- Feint

## Shield Attacks 
You can use a shield in combat as a bludgeoning weapon. Using your shield as a weapon requires a Melee attack roll and does damage equal to your Punch, but lethal. Medium shields do damage as though your Punch were two levels higher, and heavy shields do damage four levels higher. See the Hand to Hand table on pg.48.

## Defenses
When defending against attacks there are many options for getting clear of or stopping a killing blow. Unless marked otherwise, all of these defenses work against ranged as well as melee attacks.
- Dodge 
- Reposition
- Block
- Parry

### Defending Against an Ambush 
If you are attacked while un- aware you still have a chance to defend yourself.

### Defense and Full Round Actions
You can use a standard defensive action even if you’ve made a full-round action during the round. For example, you can still Dodge a sword strike even if you’ve spent the entire round in a Run.

## Ranged [[Weapons]] 
Anything shot or thrown counts as a ranged weapon. To make a ranged attack (Bows, Crossbows, Thrown Weapons) you must roll a combination of:

`DEX stat+Weapon skill +RNG Modifier+1d10`

greater than the defensive roll of your target. If you’re attacking an unaware or inanimate target, you must beat its target DC, augmented by its size (See Size Modifiers).

### Size Modifiers 
| Size                   | Mod |
|------------------------|-----|
| Small (Cat or nekker)  | 2   |
| Medium (Man-sized)     | 0   |
| Large (Troll or horse) | -2  |
| Huge (Fiend)           | -4  |

## Ranges and Target DC
| Ranges                                                                                | Target DC | Mod |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----|
| Point Blank <br/>The weapon is within half a meter or physically touching the target. | 10        | 5   |
| Close <br/>1⁄4 the listed range of the weapon                                         | 15        | 0   |
| Medium <br/>1⁄2 the listed range of the weapon                                        | 20        | -2  |
| Long <br/>The listed range of the weapon                                              | 25        | -4  |
| Extreme <br/>2x the listed range of the weapon                                        | 30        | -6  |

## Crossbows and Loading
Crossbows are wonders of mechanical workmanship that allow weak people to fire bolts with the same strength as trained bowmen. However they require more time to load than a bow due to their loading mechanisms. This extra time means that loading a crossbow takes 1 action.

## Bombs & Traps
Bombs and traps work slightly differently from other ranged attacks. Bombs can be thrown at a single opponent, but their damage affects an area. Everyone in that area takes the bomb’s damage to every part of their body and feels the bomb’s effects. If you fail your Athletics check, the bomb lands off target (see the Scatter table).

Traps are placed in an area. When a person enters that area they trigger the trap, and they (and anyone in the trap’s radius) feel the trap’s effect and take the trap’s dam- age to every part of their body.

## Environmental Effects
The environment can and will affect the way you travel and fight, and in some cases the weapons you choose to use. Light and dark- ness, weather, water, and terrain all change the course of battle in their own ways.

## Lighting
Light affects your aim and situational awareness.

## Snow & Ice
Snow and ice are a benefit and a hindrance. When tracking in snow you gain a +3 to Wilderness Survival to follow recent tracks, but a -3 to follow old tracks. When fighting on snow and ice you must make a DC:14 Athletics check after running or attacking to stay standing. If naked or lightly clothed in icy conditions, you can survive without shelter for a number of hours equal to your Stun. After that time has elapsed you enter Death State.

## Extreme Heat
Traveling and fighting in extreme heat is incredibly difficult even for trained warriors. When traveling through a desert environment such as the Korath desert, characters lower their STA by a third. If they are wearing medium or heavy armor, they halve their STA.

## Swampy or Overgrown Environments
When traveling and fighting in swamps or brush, you have to keep an eye on the ground around you. You take a -2 to Dodge/ Escape and Athletics.

## Fighting in Water
Fighting underwater is possible, but definitely much more difficult. While under- water you take a -3 to Awareness. When fighting with melee weapons underwater, the ROF of all weapons falls to 1, and at- tacking, blocking, and parrying are at an additional -2. While underwater, use Athletics to dodge and reposition. Thrown weapons (with the exception of spears) will not function underwater, and both crossbows and bows have their ranges quartered and their damage halved. They also suffer the -2 penalty to attack.

### Repositioning in Water
When repositioning underwater, you can move in three dimensions but are only able to move half your LEAP.
