For an example of combat, let’s pit a man at arms (Johan), a witcher (Hanson), a mage (Storm), and a criminal (Wren) against a small group of 4 ghouls.

As the sun goes down the travelers spot a group of ghouls stalking a battlefield. Before they can change course and sneak around them, the ghouls spot our would-be heroes and go on the attack.

To start with, everyone rolls initiative (REF+1d10). To keep things quick, all four ghouls have one initiative roll. Our initiative roster comes out as follows:  
1. Wren  
2. Hanson  
3. Johan  
4. Ghouls  
5. Storm

Wren goes first, drawing her long bow and fir- ing on ghoul A. She rolls an attack (DEX+Archery+1d10) and gets a total of 23. The ghoul rolls a dodge (REF+Dodge/Escape+1d10) and gets a total of 22. Wren hits. Since she wasn’t aiming she rolls 1d10 to determine lo- cation. She gets a 9 and shoots the ghoul in the left leg. She rolls her long bow damage (4d6) and gets a lucky roll of 20. Ghouls have no armor but they are resistant to steel, which halves the initial damage. On top of that, the shot was to the leg so damage is halved again. Ghoul A takes 5 points of damage, lowering its health to 20 out of 25.

Next Hanson draws his silver sword and uses the Axii sign on ghoul B. He rolls Spell Casting (WILL+Spell Casting+1d10) and gets a total of 25. The ghoul rolls to resist magic (WILL+Resist Magic+1d10) and gets a total of 13. The ghoul is stunned.

Johan, who already had his sword out just in case, runs up to the stunned ghoul and swings for its head. He rolls an attack

(REF+Swordsmanship+1d10-6) and rolls a critical 15 for a total of 25. The ghoul can’t roll dodge since it is stunned, so Johan easily hits and scores a deadly critical on the ghoul’s head. He rolls weapon damage (4d6+4) plus the bonus damage from a deadly critical and gets a total of 25. This damage is halved thanks to the ghoul’s resistance but multiplied by 3 because it struck the ghoul’s head. Johan does 36 points of damage to the ghoul and rolls to see what critical wound he inflicted. Since he aimed, he rolls 1d6 and tries to roll a 5 or 6. He rolls a 4 and damages the ghoul’s eye. The ghoul would be blinded in one eye but the 36 points of damage kills it.

Now the ghouls go, all together. Ghoul A attacks Johan and rolls a total of 20. Johan repositions (DEX+Athletics+1d10) and rolls a total of 21. He dodges back 2m before ghoul C can get to him. Ghoul C attacks and rolls a total of 19. Johan blocks with his sword (REF+Swordsmanship+1d10) and rolls a total of 22. He negates the ghoul’s damage but his sword takes 1 point of damage. Ghoul D runs at Storm and attacks with a 14. Storm dodges with an 18 and isn’t damaged.

Finally Storm falls back and spends 3 STA to casts Carys’ Hail with a Spell Casting roll of 22. Ghoul C rolls a 17 to dodge, getting struck by all 5 of Storm’s ice pellets. Ghoul C takes 2 attacks to the torso, 2 attacks to the left leg, and 1 attack to the head. Factoring in modifiers for location, the ghoul takes 14 points of damage (4+4+1+2+3), bringing it down to 11 of its original 25 HP.

With one round of combat done, the ghouls are missing one of their number and the players are still unharmed. The combat continues like this until either all the enemies (or players) are dead or one side escapes combat. Since each round encompasses 3 seconds, most combats are over in less than a minute.
