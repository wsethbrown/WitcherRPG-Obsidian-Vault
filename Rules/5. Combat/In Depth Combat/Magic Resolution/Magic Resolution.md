## Magic Attacks
Magical attacks are a mage’s main weapon and a good backup for witchers and priests. The effects of these attacks can vary but they all use WILL instead of REF or DEX. The formula for magical attacks is:

`WILL Stat+Spell Casting skill +1d10`

## Vigor Threshold & Stamina
Casting spells, invocations, and signs draws magic (referred to as chaos) from the elemental realms through your body to create a magical effect. Every magically capable character has a Vigor Threshold which shows how much magic you can channel through your body (in one round) before you start to damage yourself. You can cast as many spells as your Actions allow so long as the total STA Cost is below or equal to your Vigor Threshold.

Your power also depends on your STA de- rived statistic. This is how much magic you can use before you become exhausted and pass out. When you cast a spell or use magic, you subtract the STA Cost from your STA. If you have no Stamina left you become [[stun|stunned]] and must recover 20 points of Stamina (via Recovery Actions) and make a Stun save to recover.
## Overexertion and Fumbles
While casting magic you can overexert yourself to cast bigger spell, invocations or signs. You can attempt to cast a form of magic that has a larger STA Cost than your Vigor Threshold by sacrificing Health Points. For every 1 point of Stamina cost beyond your Vigor Threshold, you must spend 5 HP. When overexerting yourself to cast a spell you also roll on the Elemental Fumble Effect table.

If you fumble while casting magic, you risk damaging your body. As with any fumble, you must apply the total fumble roll to the appropriate fumble table. In this case, this is the Magic Fumble Outcome table.

### Overexerted Priests 
Priest use magic differently than mages. They draw a little bit of magic from many different elements to achieve the effects they want. This means that a priest who overexerts or fumbles always uses the mixed elemental fumble result.

## Magical Criticals
Magic that cause physical damage can cause critical wounds. If the magic strikes the opponent with a physical force (a rock, shard of ice, blast of air, or the like) the attack can cause critical wounds like a regular weapon.

### Magic Fumble Outcome - Will (Magic) Roll
| 1d10 | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-6  | Magic sparks and crackles and you take 1 point of damage for every point you fumbled by, but the spell still goes off.                                                                                                     |
| 7-9  | The magic that is already partially through you ignites inside you. Not only does the spell fail but you suffer an elemental fumble effect as noted below.                                                                 |
| >9   | Your magic explodes with a catastrophic effect. Not only do you suffer an elemental fumble effect, but any focusing item you are carrying explodes as if it were a bomb (doing `dice: 1d10` damage) with a 2 meter radius. |

### Elemental Fumble Effect

| Earth   | The earth around you rocks. You take 1 point of damage for every point you fumbled by and are also stunned.                                                            |

## Magical Focuses
Mages and Priests can use magical staves and amulets to lower the STA Cost of a spell by a specific amount based on the focus. Magical focuses can never bring a STA Cost below 1 point and must be in the mage’s hand to work. A mage or priest can only utilize one focus at a time, even when carrying several. Weaving magic through focuses takes a great deal of attention and control.

## Dimeritium, Bane of Magic
Dimeritium is a precious metal found sparsely all over the world. Due to its composition it has anti-magic properties, which makes it impossible for average magic users to summon up magic while touching the substance. The very presence of dimeritium can lessen a magic user’s Vigor Threshold by 1 for every unit of it within 5 meters. When forced to touch dimeritium, a magic user reduces their Vigor Threshold to 0 and must make an **Endurance check (DC:16)** and apply the results from the Dimeritium Effects table. This check must be made every half hour as long as contact continues.

## Dimeritium [[Effects]] 
| Roll | Effect                                                                                                                                         |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ≥18  | The dimeritium makes your skin itch. You feel uncomforta- ble but nothing more.                                                                |
| ≥16  | Your skin feels itchy and you feel mildly queasy but you are unimpaired.                                                                       |
| ≥14  | Your skin feels itchy, you feel queasy, and your body spasms from time to time. Every 1d6 turns, roll a DC:15 Endurance check or be staggered. |
| ≥12  | Your skin burns and your stomach is roiling. You are nauseated.                                                                                |
| ≥10  | Your skin feels like it’s on fire and you can barely focus on anything. You must roll Stun saves every round.                                  |
| ≤10  | The dimeritium boils the magic in your system and you take 1d6 damage per round that you are touching the dimeritium.                          |

## Highly Skilled Magic Users 
Highly skilled magic users like Yennefer of Vengerberg or the infamous Vilgefortz of Rogeveen are capable of feats that most average mages couldn’t even dream of. Magic spells normally rely on incantations and hand gestures. However, high Spell Casting skill allows magic users to omit certain components when casting, as shown below.

| Skill | Requirements                                                                                 |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-6   | All magic requires spoken words and hand gesture.                                            |
| 7-8   | Spells/invocations only require hand gestures.                                               |
| 9-10  | Spells/invocations only require minor gestures, which can be made with any part of the body. |

## Magic Targeting
Spells and invocations affect different numbers of targets depending upon their range.
- Direct
- Area of Effect
- Self-Affecting

## Rituals
Rituals require more focus and precision than the average spell or incantation. Cast- ing a ritual requires specific components for the ritual, and significant time. Much like crafting, you must spend the amount of time listed for the ritual first. Next, roll a Ritual Crafting check against the DC of the ritual. If you succeed, the ritual is successful. If you fail, the ritual has no effect, and the ritual components are used up. If you fumble a ritual, you take 1 point of damage for each point of Stamina spent.

## Being Interrupted
If you are interrupted by something before you can finish the ritual, you must make a Ritual Crafting roll to keep focus and continue. The DC to continue the ritual is 15 if you were shaken, bumped, yelled at, or had something tossed at you. If you are attacked and physically harmed, the DC to continue the ritual is 18. If you are physically removed from the ritual area, you can continue if you get back to the area in 1 round and make a **DC:16 Ritual Crafting** check.

## Group Ritual
Other people can help you perform a ritual. These people don’t have to be magically po-ent, but they must be able-bodied enough to help draw chalk circles, place ritual items, or recite text. Every person you have helping you (maximum 4) lowers the DC of the ritual by 1.

## Hexes
Hexes function a bit differently from both spells/invocations and rituals. To weave a hex you must draw not only a certain amount of magic, but also personal hatred for the targeted person or place. Failing to cast a hex does nothing. There’s no backfire unless you fumble. If you do fumble, you have a 50% chance of inflicting the hex on yourself. This replaces the standard elemental effects and damage from fumbling a form of magic.
