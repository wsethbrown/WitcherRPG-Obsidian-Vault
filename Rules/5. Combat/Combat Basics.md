### Rounds
Before you begin playing the Witcher TRPG you’ll have to know the ins and outs of rounds. A round is a time block of about 3 seconds. Rounds signify the order in which things happen in game. Rounds primarily are used during combat but GMs also use them to keep track of screen time, AKA how long people get to be the center of attention in the game. In and out of combat, during a round every person in the scene has a chance to act. These actions are all taken simultaneously within the space of 3 seconds.

### Initiative
Initiative measures how quickly the participants, usually in a com- bat, react to the situation around them. Before going into rounds, you put the players and NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in order from the highest initiative to the lowest. This is the order in which the GM asks for your action that round. When the person with the lowest initiative has gone, go back to the person with the highest initiative.

To get your initiative, roll 1d10 and add it to your REF stat. If players roll a tie, remember the number they rolled. Have them roll again. The players go at their original initiative, but in order by their second roll. Though there are some ways to temporarily change your initiative (see Fast Draws), you usually keep the same initiative for the entire combat or scene.

### Actions
In one round, you have enough time to move a distance equal to your SPD in meters and perform one action. Speaking is never considered an action except during Verbal Combat.

### Extra Actions & Defense
You can spend 3 points of STA to take one extra action (at a -3) at any point during your turn. Similarly, if you are forced to take more than one defensive action during a round (repositioning, blocking, etc.), each action costs 1 STA. However, if you chose to use your action to actively dodge, you do not suffer STA drain for defending.

# Line of Sight, Vision Cone, & Facing
To perform most attacks against a target, you must have line of sight to the target and be within range. Line of sight means having nothing between you and your target that obscures your view of the target. If there is nothing between you and your target, you have clear line of sight. If there is something solid between you and your target, you don’t. See Using Cover for cases when solid objects partly obscure your target.

Your vision cone deter- mines what you can see around you. Anything outside of your vision cone is invisible to you. When targeting something outside of your vision cone you take a -3 to the attack and cannot aim. An enemy outside of your vision cone gains a +3 to their attack against you.

Normally your vision cone includes everything in front of you from one shoulder to the other. When wearing a helmet with restricted vision your view is limited to a cone directly in front of you, and a witcher’s Awareness bonus and Scent Tracking are disabled.

Finally, your facing is just what direction you’re facing and thus what direction your vision cone is facing. Changing facing as part of your movement does not count as an action.

# Ambushes
You gain bonuses against enemies by sneaking up on them. You must be the one to instigate a combat to ambush a target. First, make a successful Stealth check against the target’s Awareness check. If you succeed, you go unnoticed and can sneak up on your opponent. Next, make your attack. Your target still gets to defend themselves but you gain a +5 against all targets who were unaware of you. This bonus lasts for the first round of the combat. If one of your targets notices you but doesn’t have time to alert the rest, you still get the bonus against those who aren’t aware. After you make your ambush attack, everyone in the area makes an initiative roll and initiative continues from there. Your first attack (the ambush) isn’t counted in the initiative.

# Ganging Up
When a person is attacked by multiple assailants in melee range (adjacent or within 2m with a reach weapon) they take a -1 penalty to defense for every assailant beyond the first. For example, if you were surrounded by four Nekkers you would take a -3 to your defense.

# Damage
Damage is split into two categories: lethal and non-lethal. Any wound that brings you closer to death deals lethal damage. When your amount of lethal damage is equal to your Health Points, you enter Death State and begin dying (see Death Saves). Temporary damage that impairs you (concussion, shock) is non-lethal dam- age. When you have taken non-lethal dam- age equal to your current Stamina, you are knocked unconscious and treated as stunned until you recover at least 20 points of Stamina with recovery actions and make a Stun save.
Damage of both types is usually determined by rolling different combinations of 6- or 10-sided dice. Different weapons also do one of four different damage types: piercing, slashing, bludgeoning, and elemental.

# Fast Strike Versus Strong Strike
When making an attack you can make either a fast strike or a strong strike. A fast strike allows you to attack twice in one round without penalty. These attacks don’t have to be made against the same target as long as both targets are within range. Fast strikes can be very useful when you are surrounded by a large group of enemies.

When making a strong strike, you make one huge attack at a -3 to your roll which does double damage against the opponent. Strong strikes are best when you need to do a lot of damage to a slower target with a lot of armor.
- Bows: When using a strong strike with a bow you pull the bow to full draw and fire, doubling the damage. Since it takes quite a bit of time to draw and nock arrows, bows can only fire once, even if making a fast strike.
- Crossbows: You cannot make strong or fast strikes with a crossbow since they have one draw length and draw weight.
# Hit Location
After you attack, determine what body part you hit. Unless you aimed for a specific spot, roll on the Humanoid or Monster Damage Location tables.

Aiming for specific parts is harder, but can be worth it. Each part has a penalty to hit it and a damage modifier. After you’ve reduced your damage based on armor (see Damage Reduction), you multiply the remaining damage based on the modifier for the location.

Monsters which have different anatomy from humans have a different table for dam- age location. When fighting a non-humanoid monster, roll on the Monster Damage Location table.

Certain types of attacks (bombs, traps, and some spells, for example) strike multiple body locations at once. Bombs and explosive traps hit everywhere, dealing their damage to every location separately. In this case, calculate full dice damage for each lo- cation separately.

# Armor
Armor is anything that makes it harder for an attack to kill you. For players, this mostly means reinforced clothing and plates of steel. For monsters, this can be hardened skin or natural shells. All armor has a stop- ping power (SP). The stopping power of armor determines how much incoming dam- age it absorbs when an attack strikes you.

When an attack strikes you, subtract the SP of your armor from the incoming damage. It’s important to remember that armor is based on location: A steel plate under your silk shirt doesn’t protect your head.

# Damage Resistance
Damage resistance (DR) is structural or magical protection from specific damage types: fireproof clothes, for instance, or scaly skin that turns blades. Like armor, DR saps the sting from attacks. If you take dam- age of a type (piercing, slashing, bludgeon- ing, elemental) you’re resistant to, halve the damage after applying your armor’s SP.

# Layering Armor
Layering armor may seem like a good idea. Stack up a gambeson, a brigandine, and some plate armor and you can laugh off a damn ballista bolt! Unfortunately it doesn’t work like that for two reasons.

First, armor is cumulative: under- neath your brigandine is a gambeson and a chain mail shirt and underneath your plate armor is another gambeson and another chain mail shirt. So your stacked gambeson, brigandine and plate armor is really three gambesons, a brigandine, two shirts of chain mail, and plate armor over top of it all. Throw in four layers of armored trousers and a great helm with two padded caps, two chain mail coifs, and leather hood? Not only do you look like the Michelin Man’s mercenary brother, you’re also wearing about 39 kilograms of armor alone, each layer adding more encumbrance. For this reason you can only stack three pieces of armor and you can only wear one layer of heavy armor and one layer of medium armor.

Second, each layer of armor doesn’t add its full SP. Any armor lighter than your heaviest armor acts as a buffer between you and the blow. To determine how much extra armor you get subtract the lighter armor from the heavier armor and find the difference on the table on the next page.

This bonus is the maximum amount of the weaker armor’s SP that is you added to your stronger armor. If you have 3 layers, calculate the layers in pairs: Compare your first and second layers to find their combined strength, then compare that augmented strength to the third set of armor to get the full strength of the armor.

# Armor Piercing
There are two armor piercing levels in the Witcher TRPG: armor piercing and improved armor piercing. Armor piercing weapons negate the damage resistance of any armor that they hit. Improved armor piercing weapons not only ignore damage resistance but also halve the SP value of the armor they hit.

# Staged Penetration
Attacks that hurt you also damage your armor, making it less resilient to further at- tacks. Each attack that penetrates a piece of armor and does damage to the wearer reduces the SP of the armor by 1 point. When the SP reaches 0, the armor is fully broken and no longer soaks any damage.

# Using Cover
When you are under fire from archers, arbalists, mages, and the like, you can choose to take cover. Anything solid that comes be- tween you and a projectile counts as cover. An attack must penetrate the cover before it can get to you. If an attack does enough damage to exceed the cover’s SP, the rest of the damage strikes you and must get through your armor before doing damage to you.

# Human Shields
We all knew it would come to this. Yes, people, animals, and monsters can count as cover when in a pinch or feeling vindictive! To use a person or creature as a human shield you have to put them between you and the attack by rolling a Brawling or Physique check against their Physique or Dodge/Escape. If you succeed, they are hit by the attack instead of you. If you are al- ready grappling or pinning the person, you are not required to make this roll and the creature you are holding is considered cover for your torso. Any attack that hits your torso hits the “shield” instead of you. For information on attacking through a human shield, see the sidebar.

# Reliability
Reliability determines how easily an item can break. It applies if you attempt to block with a weapon or shield (see Defenses, pg. 164) and to fumbles (see Criticals and Fumbles). When an item’s reliability reaches 0 it’s useless for blocking or attacking. The item can be fixed with an appropriate crafting roll (see the Crafting section).

# Wounds
Assuming your armor didn’t stop an attack, you take damage. Enough lethal damage will begin to hamper your actions. This is called your wound threshold, and it varies based on your maximum Health Points. When your current HP goes below your wound threshold, you halve your REF, DEX, INT, and WILL: you’re holding yourself together with sheer willpower and adrenaline.
