Bombs, traps, spells, and even conventional weapons can all inflict extra unpleasant effects. Each effect goes on until you take the steps specified to end it and you cannot suffer from multiple instances of the same effect at the same time.

## Prosthetics Note
In our world, simple prosthetic limbs have been around since the time of the Egyptians. If you’re interested in the story of the ultimate prosthetic bad-ass, check out Gotz Von Berlichingen whose prosthetic hand made him a legend.

## Stun: The Last Thing You want
Being poisoned, being on fire, being frozen. All of these are things you deal with during a fight. They hinder you but not so much that you can’t continue fighting. Being stunned on the other hand is incredibly dangerous. While stunned you are a sitting duck. Any opponent who wants to attack you is likely going to and will often score critical wounds since you aren’t in any shape to dodge. Luckily, being struck once (even if it doesn’t penetrate your armor) will snap you out of your stunned state.

## Susceptibility
Some monsters are especially susceptible to certain effects (fire, poison, etc.). Attacks the target is susceptible to do double damage. Non-damage spells of that effect type impose a -2 to resistance rolls and double their duration. The exception to this case is silver. All monsters are considered susceptible to silver (see Monster Resistances and Silver).
## Resistances
Some monsters are resistant or even immune to specific effects. This could be be- cause a magical force protects them, or due to attunement with that particular force. If a subject is immune to a force then that force does not affect it in any way. If a subject is resistant to a force, it takes half damage from that force and get a +2 on all rolls to resist it.

## Fire Damage 
Monsters are resistant to all non-silver weapons. However, this does not apply to fire.

## Healing Yourself
You can attempt to stabilize your own wounds, but it is much harder due to Wound Threshold penalties.

## Monster Resistances and Silver 
All monsters, except beasts, are resistant to non-silver weapons and thus take half dam- age from any weapon not made of silver. All such monsters are susceptible to silver in- stead, though this susceptibility manifests differently. Due to an unknown force, silver repels monsters and burns them. A silver weapon striking a monster does the extra damage noted in the weapon’s stats. A silver object that is not a weapon does an extra 1d6 damage. If a piece of silver becomes lodged in a monster, they take damage as if poisoned until they take an action to pull it out.

## Death Saves
When you have been knocked below 0 Health Points you are put into Death State. In Death State, all your stats (both primary & derived) fall to 1/3 normal and you must make a Death save at the same value as your unmodified Stun save. If you fail this save, you die and no amount of magic can bring your back. If you succeed, you survive for that round.

Each round you must make another Death save at a cumulative -1. On a successful roll you survive. On a failure you die. A tough player can survive for quite a while, but eventually you’re gonna cash out. Every time you are injured in Death State you must make another Death save at a cumulative -1.

## Stabilization
To stop someone from dying, you must stabilize them. To stabilize a character, make a First Aid roll at a DC equal to how far the character is below 0 Health Points. If you fail the patient continues to die, but if you succeed they are brought back to 1 Health Point and leave Death State.

## Stabilizing a Critical Wound 
If you can’t get to a doctor immediately and your injury is killing you, you can attempt to stabilize the wound. Stabilizing a critical wound lessens its effects so you can keep fighting or get to a doctor in time. Stabilizing a wound requires one First Aid check with a DC based on the severity of the wound (see the Stabilization table). Stabilizing a wound doesn’t heal it. The healing clock only starts once someone applies Healing Hands or healing spells on it.

### Stabilization 
| Critical  | DC |
|-----------|----|
| Simple    | 12 |
| Complex   | 14 |
| Difficult | 16 |
| Deadly    | 18 |
