When you’re running a more diplomatic game or have a lot of bards, merchants, or talkative characters, you may want to use this Verbal Combat system, which grants persuasion and other verbal skills their own “combat.” When starting a Verbal Combat, each party establishes what their goal is in the combat. Each player then determines their Resolve, which acts as their Health Points for the Verbal Combat.

`Resolve = ((WILL + INT)/2)x5`

A Verbal Combat works much like a regular combat, with each person using an attack and their target defending with one of the defenses noted on the next page. The person who rolls higher does the damage listed to their opponent’s Resolve. The person whose Resolve falls to 0 first loses the combat and is convinced of whatever their opponent is arguing. A Verbal Combat can take place between any number of people, and you can aim attacks at any or all your opponents in the argument, who all get a chance to defend. Each person who succeeds in defending does damage to the attacker’s Resolve. Instead of attacking you can use one of the Verbal Combat tools. These take one full turn to use, but help you in a Verbal Combat.

## Empathetic vs Antagonistic
Verbal Attacks are split up into empathetic and antagonistic. Empathetic attacks aim to endear your target to you. They offer more options, but tend to be weaker and entirely reliant on your EMP. Antagonistic attacks, on the other hand, are often more powerful and can benefit from torture and torment. The catch is that antagonistic attacks are more likely to win you the combat and ensure that your target either avoids you or acts as your enemy in the future.

## Making Friends
Making a friend of your opponent makes them an official Acquaintance (as per Lifepath). They will be friendly towards you and won’t actively act against you without good reason. The second time you befriend and opponent you make them a dedicated friend. This means they will not only be friendly but also be likely to do things for you and help you out. The third time you befriend an opponent they become a “blood-brother” and will do just about anything for you as long as it’s reasonable.

## Modifiers in Verbal Combat
Just like in “to-the-death” combat, Verbal Combat can also use modifiers to augment rolls. If you are trying to intimidate a fully armed and armored knight with a spoon or trying to seduce a grieving widower at their wife’s funeral it’s going to be quite a bit harder than convincing a bartender to give you a drink on the house. On the other hand, bribing a greedy tollkeeper or convincing someone to do something they might want to do anyway is easier than getting that aforementioned drink. Largely, modifiers in Verbal Combat are left up to the GM’s discretion. When in doubt, keep in mind that a mild modifier is a 1, a moderate modifier is a 3, and a major modifier is a 5. This should allow you to add modifiers to just about any situation by gauging the se- verity of the situation.

## Torture & Torment
If you have a target at your mercy and do damage to them, you take negatives to empathetic attacks and gain bonuses to antagonistic attacks. Harming a target gives you a -3 to empathetic attacks but grants a +3 to Intimidation. Bringing a target down to their wound threshold gives you a -10 to empathetic attacks but a +10 to Intimidation.
