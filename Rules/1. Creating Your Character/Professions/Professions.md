# Professions

In the Witcher TRPG, your profession is what you do to make your living. This is what your are best at and determines your basic skill set and starting possessions. Remem- ber, your profession only establishes what you do for a living. Except in the case of magic, it does not limit how good you can be at other things. It establishes where you’ll probably want to focus your improvement but does not tie you down. The best example of this is Zoltan Chivay (in the Witcher video games). Zoltan, one of Geralt of Rivia’s best friends, is a hard-drinking, hard-fighting dwarf who helps hold the walls of Vergen against the forces of King Henselt of Kaedwen. By profession, Zoltan is a merchant and later a tavern owner.

 Each profession has five parts:

> |1. Defining Skill|
> |--|
> Each profession has a defining skill. This one skill separates this profession from all of the others—an ability that only a person with years of training in that field can ac- quire. The defining skill is counted in the profession skill package when buying skills.

>>|Mage Limitations|
>>|---|
>>The only two races to mani- fest magic to any great extent are humans and elves. You can only play a priest or a mage if you chose human or elven as your race. Keep in mind, that elves have no established priests in their society so any elven character wishing to play priest must follow a human deity.
