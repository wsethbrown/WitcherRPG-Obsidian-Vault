# Skill Trees
>[!column]
>>[!info]
>>Each profession in The Witcher TRPG has a Profession Skill Tree which offers many variations on the core Profession. Each tree has three paths that represent differ- ent approaches to that Profession. At the very bottom is the starting ability for the Profession. As you proceed through the game you can use Improvement Points to travel down any of these paths, or venture down all of them a bit. When you have 5 points in an ability, you can use the next ability in that Profession Path at a value of 0.

>>Gaining points for each new ability works the same as gaining points in any new skill. You can go from your core skill down any one of the three paths, but it must be along the path (For example: Core Skill to A1, B1 or C1). You cannot hop from one path to another, so if you have points in A3 and want to get to B3, you must work your way all the way up Profession Path B. This allows you to play multiple variations of the same Profession and gives you lots of useful perks to pursue.
