## Magical Training (INT)
To qualify as a Mage, a magically adept person must pass through the halls of one of the world’s magical academies and learn the fundamentals of the magical arts. A Mage can roll Magical Training whenever they encounter a magical phenomenon, an unknown spell, or a question of magical theory. The DC is set by the GM, and a success allows the Mage to recall everything there is to know about the phenomenon. Magical Training can also be rolled as a form of Awareness that detects magic that is in use, or specters.

|==Scheming (INT)==|==Reverse Engineer (INT)==|==In Touch==|
|A Mage can make a Scheming roll at a DC equal to a target’s INTx3. On success the Mage gets a +3 to Deceit, Seduction, Intimidation, or Persuasion against that target from their observations of how the target works. The bonus from this ability applies for a number of days equal to the Mage’s Scheming value.|By taking 1 hour to study an al- chemical solution a Mage can roll Reverse Engineer at a DC equal to the Crafting DC for the alchemical item +3. Success allows them to reverse-engineer and write down the item’s formula. This formula is 3 points harder to craft, but reliably creates the desired item.|As a Mage utilizes magic more and more, their body becomes more used to the flow. Every point a Mage has in In Touch grants +2 points to Vigor threshold. When this ability reaches level 10 your maximum Vigor threshold becomes 25. This skill can be trained, like other skills.|
|==Grape Vine (INT)==|==Distillation (CRA)==|==Immutable (WILL)==|
|A Mage can take 1 hour and make a Grape Vine roll against a target’s EMPx3. Success spreads rumors throughout a settlement or city, lowering the target’s reputation there by half your Grape Vine value for a number of days equal to your Grape Vine value.|A Mage can roll Distillation instead of Alchemy when creating an alchemical solution. Success at this roll creates a dose of that solution that has half again the effect that it would normally have, either in duration, damage, or resistance DC (your choice). Always round down when increasing.|A Mage can roll Immutable at DC:16 whenever they would normally be affected by dimeritium. Success means that the Mage mostly shrugs off the dimeritium. They are still somewhat dizzy and uncomfortable but retain half of their total Vigor threshold and can perform magic.|
|==Assets (INT)==|==Mutate (INT)==|==Expanded Magic (WILL)==|
|Once per game a Mage can make an Assets roll to remember an asset they ‘acquired’ some time ago. Take the total of your roll and distribute it between the 4 columns on the table in the sidebar to find out who you know. This asset will help you, but how much depends on their relationship with you.|A mage can spend all of their stamina and a full day experimenting on a subject to roll Mutate at a DC equal to (28 – (subject’s BODY + WILL)/2) to mutate the subject. Success grants the subject use of the Mutagen with the appropriate minor mutation. Failure throws the subject into Death State and inflicts the larger mutation.|By channelling magic through various magical foci a Mage can wield incredible power. A Mage can roll Expanded Magic before attempting to cast a spell or ritual, at a DC of 16. On success the mage can channel the spell or ritual through any 2 of their foci that they choose, reducing the Stamina cost twice.|

>># Relationship
>>Your relationship to an asset establishes how willing to help you they are. Enthralled assets will help you with absolutely anything. Romanced assets will help you with almost anything as long as you reaffirm your romance. Friendly assets must be convinced to stick their necks out for you. Indebted assets will only do one thing for you. Blackmailed assets will do anything for you but there is a 50% chance that they will betray you.

>># Mutation
>>An individual can only be mutated twice. Further mutations will replace existing ones.
