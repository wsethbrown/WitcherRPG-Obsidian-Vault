## Patch Job (CRA)
> [!aside]
> # Too Many Patches
> A weapon, shield, or armor which has already been patched once can only be patched again 1 more time, and this patch only brings it to 1/4th SP/Reliability (rounding down).

A skilled craftsman can patch a weapon or armor well enough to keep it working and keep its wearer/wielder in the fight, whether that be by tying a bowstring back together, sharp- ening the edge of a broken blade, or nailing a plate over a cracked shield. By taking a turn to roll Patch Job at a DC equal to the item’s Crafting DC-3 a Craftsman can restore broken armor to half its full SP or restore a broken weapon or shield to half its reliability. Until fixed at a forge, a patched weapon does half its normal damage.

|==ExtensiveCatalogue(INT)==|==MentalPharmacy(INT)==|==Augmentation (CRA)==|
|A skilled Craftsman can keep a mental catalogue of diagrams in their head at all times. When a Craftsman has memorized as many diagrams as they can, they may roll Extensive Catalogue at DC:15 to memorize one more. There is no limit, but every 10 diagrams they have memorized adds 1 to the DC.|A skilled Craftsman can keep a mental catalogue of formulae in their head at all times. When a Craftsman has memorized as many formulae as they can, they may roll Mental Pharmacy at DC:15 to memorize one more. There is no limit, but every 10 formulae they have memorized adds 1 to the DC.|A Craftsman can make an Augmentation roll at a DC listed in the Augmentation chart to augment a weapon or Armor with their crafting tools. This augmentation takes 3 rounds. While a forge isn’t required, it grants a +2 to the roll. A fumble results in the item taking damage equal to the fumble value.|
|==Journeyman (CRA)==|==Double Dose (CRA)==|==Silver Coating (CRA)==|
|A Craftsman who begins craft- ing an item can roll Journey- man at a DC equal to the item’s crafting DC. If they succeed they add +1 DMG for weapons or +1 SP for armor for every 2 points they rolled above the DC. The maximum bonus they can give to DMG or SP is 5.|Any time a craftsman sets out to make an alchemical item they can make a Double Dose roll at a DC equal to the formula’s crafting DC. If they succeed they create two units of the formula with the ingredients of one. This applies to all items created with alchemy, including potions, oils, decoctions, and bombs.|A Craftsman can coat an existing weapon in silver with a forge and a number of units of silver ingots based on the size of the weapon. The DC for this roll is 16. If you succeed, add +1d6 silver damage to a weapon per 3 points you rolled above the DC, up to 5d6. Failing the roll breaks the weapon.|
|==Master Crafting (CRA)==|==Adaptation (CRA)==|==Pinpoint (CRA)==|
|Master Crafting allows a Craftsman to make items that are master grade. They can also roll a Master Crafting roll at any time at a DC equal to the item’s crafting DC to permanently grant armor resistance (their choice which) or weapons a 50% bleeding or -2 Stun value based on damage type.|Craftsmen can roll an Adaptation check (3 + the crafting DC) before making a witcher potion to lower its DC to avoid poisoning by 1 for every point over the crafting DC. If they fail, the potion comes out as poisonous as it normally would be. The DC to avoid poisoning can never be lower than 12.|A Craftsman can roll Pinpoint with a DC equal an item’s craft- ing DC to search for a flaw in the item’s design. This takes 1 turn of studying, but allows the Craftsman to make a targeted attack at a -6 to do ablation damage to the armor or weapon equal to half their Pinpoint value in 6-sided dice.|
