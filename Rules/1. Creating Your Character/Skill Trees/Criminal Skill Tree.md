## Practiced Paranoia (INT)
Whether they’re an assassin, a thief, a counterfeiter, or a smuggler, criminals all share a practiced paranoia that keeps them out of trouble. Whenever a Criminal comes within 10m of a trap (this includes experimental traps, Man at Arms booby traps, and ambushes) they immediately can make a Practiced Paranoia roll at either the DC to spot the trap, the ambushing party’s Stealth roll, or a DC set by the GM. Even if they don’t succeed in spotting the trap, they are still aware that something is wrong.

|The Thief|The Gang Boss|The Assassin|
|---|---|---|
|==Case The Area (INT)==|==Weak Spot (EMP)==|==Careful Aim (DEX)==|
|A Criminal can take an hour to wander the streets of a Settlement and roll Case the Area against a DC in the Case The Area chart. If successful, the Criminal memorizes guard patterns, street layouts, and hiding spots for a +2 to Stealth in that area for a number of days equal to their Case the Area value.|A Criminal can roll Weak Spot against a sentient target’s Deceit roll to identify the tar- get’s most valued possession or person. This also grants the Criminal a +1 to Intimidate for every 2 points they rolled above the target’s Deceit. This Intimidation bonus lasts until something happens to change the target’s weak spot.|A Criminal who’s not in active combat and takes a round to aim can roll Careful Aim at a DC equal to their target’s REFx3 to gain a bonus on their next attack equal to half their Careful Aim value. Being spotted after making this roll but before attacking halves the bonus.|
|==Mental Key (INT)==|==Marked Man (WILL)==|==Eye Gouge (DEX)==|
|Whenever a Criminal success- fully picks a lock they can roll Mental Key at a DC equal to the Lock Picking DC to memorize its tumbler positions. This allows the Criminal to open the lock without a Lock Picking roll. You can memorize as many locks as you have points in INT and can always replace one.|A Criminal can roll Marked Man at a DC equal the target’s EMPx3 to mark a target by carving a mark on their door, or the like. If successful the target must make a Charisma, Persuasion, or Intimidation check that beats your Marked Man roll to get any help or service from anyone in their settlement.|A Criminal can roll Eye Gouge in place of an attack to temporarily blind a target. Eye Gouge requires the Criminal to be in melee range and imposes a -3 to hit. However if it hits, the target takes an unmodified 2d6 damage and is blinded for a number of rounds equal to the Eye Gouge value.|
|==Go To Ground (INT)==|==Rally (WILL)==|==Assassin’s Strike (DEX)==|
|Once per session a Criminal can roll Go To Ground to find a hideout where they can lie low for a while. Take the total value of your Go to Ground roll and split the points between the 3 categories in the Go To Ground table in the sidebar. This hideout remains until destroyed, and you can always return to it.|Once per day, by taking an hour, a Criminal can roll a Rally check against a DC set by the GM. For every 2 you roll above the DC they recruit 1 Bandit for a number of days equal to your Rally value. If a Bandit is knocked below half health they must roll under the Criminal’s WILL on a 10 sided die or flee.|When ambushing a target, a Criminal can make an As- sassin’s Strike roll against the target’s Awareness roll to conceal themselves after an attack. This ability can be used in any situation but imposes penalties based on light and cover condi- tions. Multiple opponents can each roll to spot the Criminal.|
