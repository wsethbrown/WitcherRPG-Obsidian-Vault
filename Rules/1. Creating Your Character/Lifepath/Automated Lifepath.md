# Step One - Determine Homeland
Use the following tables to automate your character's lifepath. 

Use **Determine Origin** to determine if your character's origins are in the Northern Kingdoms or in Nilgaard. See **The Elderlands** if you're playing a Dwarf or Elf race.

Once you've Determined your Origin, roll on the respective tables for Northern Kingdoms or Nilfgaardian Origin. If your roll is **Vassal** on the Nilfgaard table, use the **Vassal Origin** table.

After you've completed your character's origin, roll to create your family and friends throughout your character's life.

Finally, determine your character's **Life Events** by rolling on each table once for every decade your character has been alive.
