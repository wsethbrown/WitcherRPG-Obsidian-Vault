# Lifepath
In the world of The Witcher your early life can be very important. Not only does it tell you what land you grew up in, but also what kind of environment you lived in, what the people around you were like, and even what skills you learned. This is also the point at which you decide which of the three sides of the Third Northern War you hail from. This may not reflect what side you are on now, but it will tell you what you grew up knowing about the conflict and what people will expect of you.

>|Chance VS Choice|
>|:---:|
>|With GM permission, you can choose each part of your Lifepath instead of rolling it. However, we recommend going through the Lifepath randomly once or twice to see what you get!|
>
>|The Elderlands|
>|:---:|
>|As a non-human you can choose to come from one of the traditional homelands of the elder races: the Mahakaman Mountains or Dol Blathanna. This is not mandatory and you can roll on the table for your homeland instead.|

>|Witcher Lifepath|
>|:---:|
>|As a witcher you roll on a witcher-specific Lifepath in the “Running a Witcher” Section on pg.237. If you want, you can roll on the Lifepath tables to see what the family you were taken from was like, but they are most likely dead and you do not gain the benefits of the rolls.|

>|Homeland|
>|:---:|
>|You can find more information on your homeland in the World section, starting on pg.179. If you rolled Cintra as your homeland you’ll have to look under Nilfgaard. Cintra was only captured a few years ago, and many still hold hope of taking it back from Nilfgaard.|
