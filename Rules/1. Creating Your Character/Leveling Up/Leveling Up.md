>> [!info] Leveling Up
>>To level up a skill, you allot Improvement Points (I.P.) to it. For most skills you must spend an amount of I.P. equal to the current level of the skill to raise its value by 1. If you want to raise your skill by multiple levels, you must pay the cost for each level in total. For Example: If I want to take my Swords- manship from a 4 to a 5 I need to spend 4 I.P. But if I want to go from 4 to 7 I have to pay 15 I.P. (4+5+6=15).

>> [!info] General Improvement
>> The fastest way to learn a skill is via experi- ence. At the end of a session your GM gives out general Improvement Points to apply on any skill that you used during that adven- ture. Generally a GM should be even-hand- ed with I.P.; we suggest not giving out more than 6 I.P. to any one player per game ses- sion, unless they do something spectacular.

>>[!info] Being Taught
>>By finding a mentor or a teacher and learn- ing under them, you can learn higher principles in a specific skill and eventually excel in it. However, your teacher must have a higher level in the skill than you and must have the time to teach you. Your GM decides the length of the lesson; usually les- sons give 1-5 I.P. each. The Teaching skill sets how far a mentor can take you. The teacher averages their Teaching skill with their own skill in what you’re learning. They can raise your skill to that value. A mercenary with a 10 in Swordsmanship but a 2 in Teaching could still only teach you up to 6th level in Swordsmanship. But a teacher with only an 8 in Swordsmanship but a 10 in Teaching could teach you up to level 8.

>>[!info] Study & Practice
>>By setting time aside to study and practice a skill you can learn the basics. You can only raise skills from +0 to +2 via this method; you have no guidance and therefore you will make mistakes along the way. It takes a day of book learning or active practice to gain 1 I.P. in a skill.

>[!info] Raising Stats
>With intensive training, you can raise a Statistic much like a skill. To raise a Stat you must spend a number of I.P. equal to the level of the Statistic times 10. This will raise all Derived Stats such as Stamina and Health. You still cannot raise a Statistic be- yond 10.

>Gaining a Skill
To get to 1 point in a skill you must spend 1 I.P. If the skill is difficult to learn, you must spend 2 I.P.

>[!aside]
>Difficult Skills
Skills marked with “(2)” like Language and Tactics are dif- ficult to learn. When leveling them up you must acquire I.P. equal to the current level of the skill times 2.
