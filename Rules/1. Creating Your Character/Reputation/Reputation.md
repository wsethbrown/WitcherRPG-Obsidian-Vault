# Reputation
Reputation is a measure of how well you are known for your actions, both famous and infamous. A Reputation is always established by a character’s actions and is awarded to the player by the GM. When- ever a character encounters new people in new situations, Reputation influences how they react. Every new person you meet rolls 1d10. If they roll lower or equal to your Reputation, they have heard about you and react to what they’ve heard as the GM thinks appropriate.

It is important to remember that Reputation can be bad as well as good. You could gain a name as a world-class bandit slayer but you could just as easily earn one as a coward who runs from any fight they encounter.

## Using Reputation
Reputation is a powerful thing. In the world of The Witcher it can often get you into trouble, but it can also help you get out of it. When trying to influence someone (or entering Verbal Combat), you can choose to try to face them down. If they know about your Reputation, make a Face-Down roll opposing them. Both parties roll:

1d10+[[Will]] + [[Reputation Level]]

If you succeed in this roll, the person you are facing is aware of whatever Reputation you have and can’t help but think of it in the back of their mind. If your Reputation is positive, then you gain a +3 to influencing skills that relate to your Reputation.

>>[!note] Bad Reputation
>>If either you or your opponent has negative points in Reputation, these count as an active Reputation for being a coward or otherwise unimpressive.
>
>>[!note] Different Reputations
>>A merchant with a rep for being a kind-hearted dealer who gives to charity wouldn’t get a bonus to Intimidation, and an infamously soulless murderer won’t get one to Charisma.
>
>>[!info] Titles
>>If your GM agrees, you can add a title based on your reputation. This could be anything from “the Golden Knight” to “Knife Tongue.” This won’t affect results but it will make your reputation feel real. It’s one thing to have a reputation of 5 and have people recognize you as you walk into a tavern. It’s even better to have people whispering about “the Giant Slayer Olaf.”
