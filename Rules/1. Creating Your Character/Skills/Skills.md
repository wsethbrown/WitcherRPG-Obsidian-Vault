After you get your [[statistics]], you must allocate points into your skills to determine what your character has trained in. Put- ting points in a skill means that you have trained in this skill. The more points you have in a skill, the more knowledge and experience you have with that skill. Skills can have between 0 and 10 points in them and can never go higher than 10 points. Bonuses like racial modifiers can raise a skill above 10. When first making your character, your skills cap at 6. You can raise them higher as the game progresses, however. For a better idea of what skill val- ues mean in real terms, check out the table in the sidebar.

Your first 11 skills will come from your Profession's Skill Package and Defining Skills. For these 11 skills you will have 44 points to split between them. You must put at least 1 point in each skill in your Skill Package and in your Defining Skill. After you determine your Skill Package, you can choose your Pick Up Skills, skills beyond your profession that you learned over time based on what you do and who you are. You can choose as many as you like from the list below. You may not raise Profession skills, or buy skills from your Skill Tree with Pick Up Skill points. You have a number of skill points for Pick Up Skills equal to your Intelligence Statistic plus Reflex Statistic.

>**Difficult Skills**
>It is important to note that while most skills cost 1 point to raise 1 level, skills that are marked with a (2) next to them require 2 points per level in the skill.
>** Home Language**
You are considered fluent in the language of your home- land. This means that you start with a +8 in your own home language for free and do not spend points on it. If you are from Nilfgaard, Dol Blathanna or Skellige you speak the Elder Speech, though they are separate dialects (see Dialects). If you are from the North you speak Common Speech, also known as Nordling. If you are from Mahakam you speak Dwarven.
