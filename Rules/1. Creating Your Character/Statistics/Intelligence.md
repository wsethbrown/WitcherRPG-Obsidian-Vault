For solving puzzles, performing science, deduction, and the like.

  # Awareness
 Noticing things or spotting abnormalities in your environment. At a base 10 you are a relatively aware person, noticing people walking by you and large changes in the environment. At a base 13 you are very aware, noticing small changes in the environment and hearing an average per- son trying to be stealthy. At a base 16 you are acutely aware, able to pinpoint minute changes in your environment and rarely taken by surprise. At a base 20 you are hyper-aware and nearly nothing happens in your environment without you noticing. Even invisible creatures have a hard time sneaking by you.

# Business
Starting and operating a business. At a base 10 you can manage a basic lemonade stand. At a base 13 you could probably run a tavern and not go out of business. At a base 16 you are a successful businessman who has probably run businesses in the past and rarely makes mistakes. At a base 20 you are a master of business, capable of running not just a business but a mercantile empire.

# Deduction
The skill of deducing a conclusion from clues given to you. At a base 10 you often get hunches that point you in the right direction. At a base 13 your hunches are usually right and you can back them up with logical reasoning. At a base 16 you generally can find what has occurred or what may occur with only a few clues. At a base 20 your deductions are almost never wrong and you can find answers with the barest of clues.

# Education
The level of formal education you have received. At a base 10 you have basic knowledge, the amount you would get from a parent explaining the world to you. At a base 13 you probably mentored under someone or attended one of the few schools around where you lived. At a base 16 you collect knowledge, probably having gone to Oxenfurt or another such college. At a base 20 you are a highly educated individual who stumps college professors and mage advisors.
# Language (2)
Skill in speaking a specific language. The languages that can be learned via Language are Common Speech (the language of the Northerners), Elder Speech (the language of the Nilfgaardians, Skelligers, and non-humans besides dwarves), and Dwarven (the language of the dwarves). At a base 10 you know the basics of a language and can read it slowly; when you speak your accent is atrocious and you are slow and ponderous. At a base 13 you know the language well enough to read, write, and speak it but some technical words and slang elude you. At a base 16 you are totally fluent in the language and can even work out some dialects. At a base 20 you are not only fluent in the language but you know all dialects and ancient forms of the language.

# Monster Lore (2)
Skill in discerning information about monsters. At a base 10 you can tell a nekker from a ghoul. At a base 13 you know generally which monsters fit into what classifications. At a base 16 you are well-versed in the various weaknesses and strengths of all common monsters. At a base 20 you rarely encounter a beast you can’t analyze in a matter of seconds and even a witcher would be proud.
# Social Etiquette
Blending in at social functions and not making a fool of yourself in polite company. At a base 10 you know how to address nobility and can act properly when in a fancy neighborhood. At a base 13 you can attend social gatherings and not stick out like a sore thumb. At a base 16 you appear dashing—a cavalier, knowledgeable in all laws of society, fitting in with ease. At a base 20 you know even the unspoken rules of the highest courts and could probably impress the Emperor of Nilfgaard himself.
# Streetwise
Knowing the streets. This skill is less about knowing a geography and more about knowing how certain areas operate. At a base 10 you have enough knowledge to avoid muggers and know where the nice parts of a city are. At a base 13 you can generally pick up what factions hold sway in an area and why. At a base 16 you can glean a phenomenal amount about an area from studying it, identifying the important people in the city and their relationships with ease. At a base 20 you are able to assess a whole town easily, picking up enough to make you effectively a local.
# Tactics (2)
Anticipating enemy movements and planning accordingly. At a base 10 you can figure out the basics of an untrained mob’s combat plan. At a base 13 you could probably lead a small battalion of men successfully and could rout an enemy force of equal size. At a base 16 you could be placed in charge of a mercenary band and be a major military force, adapting to all kinds of situations with knowledgeable leadership. At a base 20 you could be a full-on military general, leading whole armies with the tactical and strategic knowledge to win the day against even unspeakable odds.

># Foraging
>Wilderness Survival can be used to forage for just about anything you can find in the wilderness. Foraging for food for six people is usually pretty easy, as you can see from the table below. Add +2 for to the DC for each additional person beyond six. But you can also hunt for alchemical ingredients and crafting components. The specific foraging DCs are mentioned, starting on pg.143 in the Crafting section.

# Teaching
The skill of explaining skills to others. This skill is not required to teach other skills, but it makes it a lot easier. At a base 10 you can walk a person through a basic demonstration, though they may not al- ways understand. At a base 13 you can teach the basics of a skill to a diligent pupil with no issues. At a base 16 you could teach even uninterested students the higher levels of a skill with time. At a base 20 you are master of teaching and can connect with anyone. Your lessons immediately make sense and rarely ever have to be repeated.
# Wilderness Survival
Surviving outdoors and tracking prey. At a base 10 you know how to make a fire, what common plants are poisonous, and how to follow a trail. At a base 13 you could survive in the wilderness alone with some discomfort and you could earn a living hunting. At a base 16 you could be a hermit or a ranger, living in the wilder- ness with ease. At a base 20 you know almost everything about the wilderness. There’s no natural environment that you couldn’t adapt to and no prey that can avoid you.
