# Races
In the world of The Witcher there are four playable races that each have their own abilities and drawbacks. Despite the fact that they are born as humans, witchers are considered a race of their own due to the mutations in their bodies and their unique abilities.

># Others of Your Race
>It’s important to note that you may run into others of your race while in hostile territory. Other members of your race will always treat you as equal unless they have some person- al problem with you or members of their own race.
## Social Standing
Humans are the dominant species on the Continent. After a series of wars in which the elves and dwarves sided against the humans of the north, the non-human population (elderfolk, if you’re polite) of the Northern Kingdoms has become a downtrodden group of second-class citizens. Today, race means quite a bit in day to day life. Each race has its own social standing, which indicates how people deal with your character and explains how their reaction reflects in statistics.

>|Equal|
>|:---:|
>|Characters with a social standing of equal are seen as peers. They take no penalties to social interactions but gain no bonuses either. People will generally judge them on their appearance and actions rather than their race.|

>|Tolerated|
>|:---:|
>|Characters who are tolerated are present in society but not really respected or considered equal. They take a -1 to Seduction, Charisma, Persuasion, and Leadership with people.|

>[!cards|2]
>|Feared|
>|:---:|
>|Characters who are feared are considered frightening to the average person. You only gain the feared social standing through mutation into a witcher or horrible scarring. You can gain the standing in specific places based on your actions, but that is decided by the Game Master. A character who is feared gains a +1 to Intimidation but a -1 to Charisma.|

>|Hated|
>|:---:|
>|Characters who are hated are actively despised by most people. They aren’t necessarily outcast, but are often the targets of racial aggression and hate crimes. They take a -2 to Seduction, Charisma, Persuasion, and Leadership with people.|

>[!aside]
># Friendship
>Your social standing is designed to indicate how strangers feel about you based on your race. Obviously if you’re an elf who has a long- time friend who happens to be a human, your friend won’t hate you. The same goes for lovers and, sometimes, in-laws
