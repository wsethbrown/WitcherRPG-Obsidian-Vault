```ad-quote
If I were a worse person I’d vent my spleen and tell ya all the terrible things humans have done to my people and the other elder races. But I’m better than that. Worked with a lot of humans during the Northern Wars. Hell, most of the Temerian army’s humans. Humans can be fine folks. They’re varied in nature and usually a pretty resilient race. They tend to get swept up in causes and fears pretty easily, though. They’re the dominant species on the Continent right now and they know it. Heh. It’s easy to speak ill of ‘em. They just about destroyed the elder races, wiped out the vran, killed all but a few hundred of the werebbubbs, built their cities on top of elderfolk cities, and depending on where you are they’re still killing elderfolk by the score every day. But they’re not all bad. Heh, most mages are human and they may destabilize countries and plunge the world into chaos, but they’ve also made the world better with magic and science. Human are a clever bunch, and in a pinch, a human you know well will probably have your back.

>*Ugh...Tricky topic, the North. Folk’re usually fine enough. Grew up in Maribor. Plenty ‘a humans round there. Never had too much trouble. Either way, North’s different from the black ones or the Ofieri or the Zerrikanians. Friendly enough once ya get to know ‘em but until then it can be rough sleddin’. Rare a Northerner’ll hide their intentions though. Heh, if some big Kaedweni bastard wants to cave your face in, you’ll know it, trust me! Guess I’d call ‘em honest. Traveled the south a bit and it never felt as honest. Too much plottin’ and too many fake smiles.*

>|Part of the human race’s greatest strength is its willingness to charge forward endlessly, even into truly life-threatening situations. A human can summon up their courage and reroll a failed Resist Coercion or Courage roll 3 times per game session. They take the higher of the two rolls, but if they still fail they cannot re-use the ability to roll again.|
