```ad-quote
Witchers have been a touchy issue since they were made centuries ago. Heh, but let me tell ya friend, even when they were sought after, nobody really liked ‘em. They’re raised from human children taken to one of the five Schools of the Witcher. At these witcher keeps, the children go through some kinda gruelin’ trainin’ proccess that makes ‘em into livin’ weapons. Fast as hell, trained to fight blind and hunt just about every monster any poor son of a whore’s likely to find. After a few years of this they go through a bunch of mutations. One ya hear about most’s the Trial of the Grasses. The one witcher I traveled with said only one in four kids survives this whole mess. 

The ones that survive are changed. They’ve got bright cat’s eyes and just about no fee- lin’ left in ‘em. Heard the emotion part evens out after a while. Hell, the witcher I traveled with even made a few jokes on the road. But from that moment on, they’re killers. Reborn for one purpose: killin’ monsters. And hell, see a witcher in action and you’ll see the payoff of all that hardship. Problem is they’re mutants, and if there’s one thing people hate it’s a mutant. Witch- ers have barely any charisma left in ‘em so most people think they’re cold, heartless murderers who’ll steal your gold, rape your daughter, and then put a sword in your gut.
