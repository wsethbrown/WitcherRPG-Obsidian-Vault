Heh. My friend, rivers dry up, mountains crumble, but dwarves are a constant. We may be short compared to the elves and the humans but we’re sturdier than they’ll ever be—the definition of barrel—chested! We dwarves have been around for ages, livin’ in the mountains and plyin’ our trade: forgin’. We’re friendly enough when ya get to know us and easy to get along with as long as ya don’t piss in our faces. The humans may not love us dwarves, but they need us for our skill and our steel. ‘Sides, unlike the damn elves we don’t hold an in-born grudge against the humans. We keep to our business and them to theirs. Share a drink here and there. Heh, sadly, madness is spreadin’ quick through the North and dwarves are targets now more than ever. Lucky the humans have a hard time pickin’ out our women! Never find a prettier lass than a dwarven girl. They say the fuller the beard, the fuller the...well. Ya get my point.
