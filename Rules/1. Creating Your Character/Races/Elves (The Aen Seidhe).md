```ad-quote
Elves, or the Aen Seidhe, since ours aren’t the only elves out there, are a sad tale indeed. Heh. They came to the world not long before humans, in great white ships from somewhere. Wouldn’t call ‘em the kindest of the races but they got along well enough with the rest of us. They’re not too unlike humans: tall, thin, prone to lookin’ down on others. Only difference is their pointed ears, their seemingly eternal lives, and their bond with the land. Heh, the elves are at one with nature or somethin’. Lived off the land for generations, foragin’ for food and buildin’ great palaces. Don’t even have sharp teeth after all those years of eatin’ berries and plants. Don’t get ‘em cross though; an elf ’s hell on the battlefield too. They may not wear much armor but they’re hard as frogs in winter to find in the wilderness, and probably the best archers you’ll ever see.

># Bonus Skills
>When you create your character, you cannot have a skill value higher than 6. As you level up your character, skill values cap out at 10 points. The perks that you gain from your race can raise your skill value above these ceilings. For instance, if you decide to play an elf and put 6 points into Archery right away, your Marksman perk can raise your initial Archery skill value to 8. If you level up that same character, over the course of a game you can raise your Archery skill value to a total of 10 plus the bonus Marksman value, putting you at a +12.
