## Impact on Gameplay
Just like any movie or show, the weather has an impact on a scene’s mood or atmosphere. Traveling is slightly different, but the same principle applies. Bad weather could leave characters wishing for shelter while good weather can leave them happy and filled with joy. I will admit, this weather system isn’t as refined as I’d like and the format is modeled after the Cyberpunk RED weather DLC. However, the temperatures and weather in these roll tables are modeled after Polish weather reports. Depending on where you are in the Continent, modify these tables as needed.

## Weather Rules

### Temperature
**COLD TEMPERATURE**
When tracking in snow, you gain a +3 to Wilderness Survival when tracking fresh tracks, but -3 to old tracks. When fighting snow, make a **DC:14 Athletics** check after running or attacking to stay standing. If naked or lightly clothed, you can survive without shelter for a number of hours = STUN, but after you must start making Death Saves. 

**COOL/WARM TEMPERATURE**
The weather is comfortable for the Character. 

**HOT TEMPERATURE**
EV increases by 1. In extreme heat, EV is raised by 1 even if it’s zero.

### Weather
**Blizzard**
When caught in a Blizzard, you are considered as having the Freeze Effect (PAGE 161). Any Awareness checks are done at a -2 if in Daytime and -4 at night time. If you are not wearing Cold Weather Clothing, you can survive without shelter for a number of minutes equal to your STUNx2.

**Cold Snap**
This overrides any temperature roll made. Black ice can form everywhere, allowing the GM to apply hazardous conditions due to icy surfaces. 

**Deadly Thunderstorm**
Weather can be chaotic on the continent but also can be quite thematic during a thrilling fight. The GM should roll a 1d6; 1-3 the lightning strikes far away; 4-6, strikes a nearby natural feature. If none are nearby, it might strike the tallest character or one dressed in the most metal. 

**Dust Storm**
Poor agriculture practices and drought can lead to strong winds carrying the loose soil and forms into a massive storm. Other causes could be from a severe drought, magical, or all of the above. If you’re caught out in a Dust Storm without proper face coverings, you suffer the Foreign Object Critical Injury as dust clogs your insides. The GM should also apply appropriate negative modifiers to vision and accuracy in a dust storm.

**Flooding** Powerful rainstorms can cause floods anywhere on the Continent (probably not the desert though, unless magic is involved). 

**Fog** A fog can also be traded for a Mist, but the Game Master can apply Awareness related penalties for trying to see or navigate through. 

**Heat Wave** This overrides any roll made for Temperature. See the Extreme Heat Subtitle ( PAGE 165) for the applied effect. 

**Heavy Rain/Sleet** The GM can apply penalties to Awareness or Athletics checks as they see fit. 

**Heavy Snow** This is the kind of snow that could swallow you up to your waist or head if you’re a Dwarf or Halfling. You gain a +5 to Wilderness Survival to follow recent tracks but a -5 to old tracks. When fighting off snow and ice, you must make a **DC:16 Athletics** check after running or attacking to stay standing. If naked or without proper clothing, you can survive without shelter for a number of hours equal to your STUN -2. After that time has elapsed, you enter Death State. 

**Hurricane/Tornado/Tsunami** These powerful storms can make all kinds of havoc. Use these sparingly if you must, but they can provide amazing obstacles or even quests. 

**Light Rain/Sleet** Would you wait for the dribble to pass? This is classic moody, wet, noir. Apply a -1 to a skill like climbing up a wall or making a sharp turn with a horse-drawn cart. 

**Powerful Storm** A Powerful storm is a mixture of heavy rain/sleet, a windstorm (blizzard if winter), or a Deadly Thunderstorm. 

**Snow**  See Snow and Ice on ( PAGE 165). 

**Windstorm** These powerful winds can knock trees over and you shouldn’t be out at all with one of these kicking around. If you fail a **DC:16 Athletics** check, you are knocked Prone and take `dice: 1d6` damage.
