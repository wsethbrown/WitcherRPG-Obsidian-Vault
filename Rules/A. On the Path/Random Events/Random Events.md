The reason why most travel systems in my opinion become a frustration rather than an experience is the events that happen during travel. Either nothing happens, the abstract happens, or way too much happens that it just becomes an exhaustive grind. Random combat encounters are good for dungeons because it’s all about exhausting resources. The exhaustion of resources on the road should feel natural.
The main goal of this “encounter” system was to generate roleplay moments, big and small. Some are small choices, others are big decisions with various consequences that could impact the course of a campaign. The level of risk here is often chosen by the Party rather than you as a GM. When presenting this homebrew, emphasize to the players that there is no wrong decision, only the amount of time they want to take on a particular task and the level of risk.

Now, this can require some prep on the Gamemaster’s behalf, but it doesn’t take more than a couple of hours at the max. If you’re like me, then you’ll carry on rolling for the fun of it to see what happens. Or, if you’re really good at improv, you can roll at any point during the session.

Here’s what I do:

On a spreadsheet or notebook, I list out the day, year, and all four Quarter Days. I divide weather and encounters by two Quarter Days rather than charting all four. I then roll for the temperature and weather, then encounters. If I don’t like the encounters, I’ll either skip it entirely for that quarter or re-roll to see if it’s something I like.

## Encounters

### Encounter dice
Random encounters are broken into 4 Categories:
❖ Dangerous Event (1-3) 
❖ Point of Interest (4-5) 
❖ Chance Event (6-8)  
❖ Good Event (9-10)

### DANGEROUS EVENTS
Dangerous events are generally dangerous locations like a treasure guarded by some monsters, something that happens to a player while traveling, or some other kind of risk. Most of the time, a lot of the danger is something that’s passive, that sits there until the Players decide to interact with it - unless the GM deems the threat moves. For example, if you roll Bandit Camp: 2d6 bandits in a camp, they might be sitting in a forest minding their own business. But if the Players set up camp nearby, the GM might let the Bandits creep towards the camp in the middle of the night and ambush the players. That’s not my cup of tea, but it’s something that should happen once in a blue moon.

Dangerous events are the only category that is secretly divided by event type. If the Players are exploring relatively “peaceful” landscapes, you’ll want to avoid encounters at the higher scale (above 50).

### POINTS OF INTEREST
Points of Interest took me the longest to get right. These are fairly “neutral” events that aren’t good or bad. These are interesting landmarks Players will discover on their journey, and are typically good camping spots. Whenever players go to Rest or Sleep, and you have a Point of Interest rolled, that’s the best time.

`dice: [[Event Tables#^point-of-interest]]`

### CHANCE EVENTS
As the name implies, these can swing any which way. They go from roadside ambushes to helping a merchant fix their wagon wheel.

`dice: [[Event Tables#^chance-events]]`

### GOOD EVENTS
These are much-needed “breaks” in the monotony of things. These clear up bad weather, give hints towards future goals, or even “reveal” future weather/random encounter events. You’ll see.

`dice: [[Event Tables#^good-events]]`

## TRICKS OF THE TRADE
Not all random encounters are created equal. Bad random encounters feel exhausting and forced. Lots of random roll tables like to have your encounters be a variety of hurt and pain the Gamemaster sets upon the players if they’re in a forest, out in the open, sleeping, and so on. Not all of these random encounters should happen all at once and you shouldn’t take every roll without considering what it presents. If you think you’ve rolled too many Dangerous Events, feel free to switch some out with other Event rolls for the sake of player enjoyment rather than letting the Dice Gods decide what happens. Variety is key.

This is why I like to prepare my events by rolling before the session. On one part it’s because I’m not the best at improv, but on the other it gives me a good idea of when in the journey I want these events to happen. Let’s say Monster Lair (Grave Hags): that are guarding a treasure in a ravine. I can have this happen while the players are Hiking from one hex to the other, or I can have a player who goes Hunting stumble upon this. The same goes for Hidden Ravine, it could happen while the Players are traveling or while someone’s making camp and collecting wood.

Now that you get the idea, let’s roll!

`dice: [[Event Tables#^event-roller]]`

## Customizing
Most of these events are vague enough that they can happen anywhere at any time, but the Gamemaster should make their own custom tables or modify the tables to fit the current terrain, atmosphere, and season.

## Final notes

If you made it this far, thank you. You’re why I make these homebrew documents. Not for fame and glory (because homebrew policy makes it so), but to create something I find fun and hope someone, somewhere, finds it fun too.

I’ll be honest, I struggled with playing The Witcher Pen & Paper RPG not really knowing how to play in the established world and lore. After months of using this travel system and re-reading the Witcher novels, I can say with confidence that a travel hex crawl game is what the RPG needs and can be one of the most fun low-prep campaigns you can run with the right group. With this kind of play, Players are in the driver’s seat seeking out their quests and exploring the world.
