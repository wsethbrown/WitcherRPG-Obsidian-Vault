## The Map
What map is up to you. I make my own maps (one of which I will provide) that are divided into hexagons to measure distance. My first time going at this I got into the nitty-gritty but now waved it away for a slightly more streamlined method. One hexagon is 10 kilometers across.

### Quarters of the Day
During your travels the day is divided into four Quarters Days used to measure time:
❖ **Morning**
❖ **Day**
❖ **Evening**
❖ **Night**

Each PC must choose an activity to do during that Quarter Day. Many of these activities are one-roll, which means that you spend the entire Quarter Day performing a certain action. So if you fail, you must re-take the action during the next quarter. For example, Make Camp isn’t just folding bedrolls, it’s finding a good camping spot, gathering firewood, setting up tents, and cooking. The DC that you roll is abstracted to take all of those activities into account.

These activities are:
★ **Hike**: All members of the party must choose this
activity in order to move on the map.
★ **Lead the Way**: This can be combined with Hike,
but only one person can make this roll.
★ **Keep Watch**: Can be combined with Hike, but
only one person can make this roll.
★ **Forage**: Cannot be combined with Hike. This can
be done by several people at the same time,
rolling separately.
★ **Hunt**: Cannot be combined with Hike. This can be
done by several people at the same time, rolling
separately.
★ **Fish**: Cannot be combined with Hike. This can be
done by several people at the same time, rolling
separately.
★ **Make Camp**: Cannot be combined with Hike. Can
be done by several people at the same time.
★ **Rest**: Cannot be combined with Hike.
★ **Sleep**: Cannot be combined with Hike.
★ **Explore**: Cannot be combined with Hike.

| Type of Terrain |        Movement         | DC  | Forage | Hunt |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------:|:---:|:------:|:----:|
|     Plains      |      Open Terrain       | 10  |   -1   |  +1  |
|     Forest      |      Open Terrain       | 12  |   +1   |  +1  |
|   Dark Forest   |    Difficult Terrain    | 14  |   -1   |  0   |
|      Hills      |      Open Terrain       | 12  |   0    |  0   |
|    Mountains    |    Difficult Terrain    | 18  |   -2   |  -1  |
| High Mountains  |       Impassable        | 20  |   -    |  -   |
|   Lake/River    | Requires a Boat or Raft | 12  |   -    |  0   |
|    Marshland    |     Requires a Raft     | 14  |   +1   |  -1  |
|    Quagmire     |    Difficult Terrain    | 14  |   -1   |  0   | 

## Hike
Hiking is how you move from hex to hex. Here you don’t need to specify when you take breaks and do some stretches, that’s already factored in.

|  Terrain  |     On Foot     |  On Horseback   |
|:---------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
|   Open    | 2 Hexes/Quarter | 3 Hexes/Quarter |
| Difficult |  1 Hex/Quarter  |  1 Hex/Quarter  | 

You can Hike for two of the four Quarter Days without a problem. If you want to make a Forced March and hike a third Quarter Day, everyone must make an Endurance Roll. Fumbles could lead to injuries, and failures or successes could lead to a loss of Stamina. 

### Light and Darkness

|           | Spring | Summer | Autumn | Winter |
|:---------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|  Morning  | Light  | Light  | Light  |  Dark  |
|  Daytime  | Light  | Light  | Light  | Light  |
|  Evening  |  Dark  | Light  |  Dark  |  Dark  |
| Nighttime |  Dark  |  Dark  |  Dark  |  Dark  | 

### Fast Travel
Find yourself going back the way you came? Or simply you just want to speed things up a bit.
1. Calculate the distance to the destination and divide by the average speed (hexes/day) rounded up. 
	1. Foot: # of hexes / 4 = x
	2. Horseback: # of hexes / 6 = x 
2. Reduce Food and Supplies by 1 for each day of travel 
3. Make a single Survival roll 
4. Failures and random events up to the GM

## Leading The Way
One member of the group must be designated the leader. This leader usually will act for an entire Quarter but I’ve seen leaders switch when they enter a new hex. The frequency of rolling is up to the Gamemaster. You could either roll a Wilderness Survival (Navigation) check every time they enter a new hex or do it once for the entire quarter day with the result (if bad) happening at a point of the Gamemaster’s choosing.

#### Traveling in the Dark
I don’t recommend it all that much, but it’s doable. At the least, everyone in the party takes a -2 to Awareness while performing any task in the dark. The Gamemaster could, however, make things harder.

## Keep Watch
During every Quarter Day, someone should be the “scout” or “on Watch”. However, this lookout cannot be doing much else but Hiking. If there is an encounter, the Lookout will roll an opposed Awareness vs DC/Awareness/Stealth, etc. with the defender winning the tie. 

Your lookout is also useful after you’ve made camp if your Gamemaster wants to spring on a random encounter in the night. If you have a Witcher with points into Meditation, you might not even need a lookout during the night.

## Foraging/Gathering
You can spend a Quarter Day looking for edible plants, alchemical ingredients, or crafting components. If you 3 want to do any of these, you must stop in the current hex that you’re in and make the appropriate check.

## Hunting & Fishing
These activities are best handled as one rolls unless there’s potential for something interesting to happen. Balance with this homebrew is key. You want things to be fast enough that it doesn’t feel like you’re spending the entire session waiting for your hunters to finish arguing if they want to fight that bear or not, but you also don’t want to rob players of their roleplay. With the exception of * animals, all of these events are pass or fail with no chance to re-roll until the next Quarter Day for the sake of everyone’s sanity at the table (speaking from experience).

** Will attack you if you fail

Instead of rolling for Food, you can eat the meat you collect if you have Cooking Tools. Raw Meat spoils after 1 day unless it’s preserved with Adda's Tomb. 

Fishing is an activity that can be performed by multiple players. All it takes is a **DC:12 Wilderness Survival** check and provides `dice: 1d6` Raw Meat.

## Making Camp
When the players have decided to stop and make camp, this process can be done by more than one person, but a singular player needs to make the roll. The DC lowers by 1 per player assisting. If your roll succeeds, you not only find a suitable spot that’s safe, but also has access to resources, is comfortable, and you’re able to cook, clean, chop wood, etc. It’s possible to sleep without making camp such as finding a nice cave or a good tree to sleep under. To do so, everyone makes a DC:14 Wilderness Survival Skill Check. Failure leaves you fatigued (-2 to all Actions for the day) as maybe the spot was rough to sleep on, didn’t protect you from the elements, or had some other reason for a horrible rest.

## Resting
If you’re recovering from wounds or simply want to catch up with NPCs and fellow members of the party, then you can stop and spend an entire Quarter Day. This is usually done after the camp has been made.

## Sleeping
You have to sleep at least one Quarter Day per day (usually during the night) to avoid exhaustion. If your sleep is interrupted, let’s say by a troublesome bear, your activity during the Quarter Day no longer counts as sleep. Going without at least one Quarter Day of sleep will give you a -2 to everything you attempt to do for each day since you last slept for a full Quarter Day.

># Rest and HP
>To regain HP equal to your REC stat, you need to spend at least 1 Quarter Day Resting and 1 Quarter Day Sleeping. If you spend only 1 Quarter Day sleeping or resting, you only gain half of your REC stat back in HP.

## Exploring
Ah, what we do best. Delving into dangerous ruins, stopping into a village, and checking that cave out. This 4 can take anywhere from one Quarter Day to two Quarter Days. It’s up to the GM.
