An abstract measure of trail rations, food, water, tinder, firewood, horse feed, and so on. These are broken into two categories: Food and Supplies. At the end of every day, each player rolls two d10s. Much like a Stun Save, your objective is to roll under the current amount of Food and Supplies you have. If you succeed, you reduce each category by 1. If you fail, you lower each category by 2.

## The Abstract
It’s best not to think too literally about the individual units or weight of these. Food depletes over the day as you eat on rests, cook meat, feed your horses and so on. Firewood, water, all those supplies also go throughout the course of the day. The idea of rolling is because life is never perfect. Sometimes you burn through more wood one day than the other, sometimes you lose some food in the cooking process from burning or waste.

## Costs
Again, you can go as in-depth as you want to. The most players will spend on food is Trail Rations (1 Day) which is cheaper than Raw Meat. Supplies will be your biggest haul in terms of crowns.

|      Item       | Cost | Weight |
|:---------------:|:----:|:------:|
| Travel Supplies |  10  |   5    | 

You can fit 4 Travel Supplies in a single Sack for a total of 40 Crowns. Now, this is only 4 days worth of supplies per person, so it’s always good to double the amount or purchase a little extra in case something happens or you’re traveling for much longer. 

Again, what’s in Supplies is abstract. A player can’t say “I go collect some Timber, therefore I can’t deplete supplies.” That’s just not true. Here are some items: 
★ Water 
★ Food for animals 
★ Cooking ingredients like flour, eggs, etc. 
★ Dry Firewood 
★ Tinder 
★ Tea 
★ Clothing & tent repair materials 
★ Bowls, plates, cups 
★ Spices 
★ Butter

You get the idea. This isn’t a definitive list either, just some ideas. Your players aren’t living off dried fruits and nuts 24/7 either, they’re making flatbreads with some flour for dinner, and frying eggs in the morning.

## Starvation
Running out of Supplies isn’t the end of the world. Running out of both Food and Supplies is. Your character can survive a number of days up to their REC stat without Food and Supplies, then you start making Death Saves. Every day they go without both, they must make a DC:14 Endurance check. If they fail, they take a -2 to all actions that day
