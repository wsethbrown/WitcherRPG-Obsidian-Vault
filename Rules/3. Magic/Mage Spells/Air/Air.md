## Fine Telekinesis
When manipulating an object with Telekinesis, you are basically just bending powerful wind around it. This al lows you to lift objects, push objects, and to some extent hold objects. Any skill-based task you try to perform with Telekinesis, such as tripping a foe, maneuvering something through an obstacle course, or (god help you) swinging a sword, uses your Will and Spell Casting at a -3. Complex actions like picking locks, firing bows, and loading crossbows are incredibly difficult, taking a -5. If you choose to throw something with telekinesis use your WILL stat instead of your BODY to calculate range.
