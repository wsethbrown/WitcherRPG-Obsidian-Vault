## Blind Teleporting
You can teleport to a place you don’t know as long as you have an item from that location. For instance you can teleport to a stranger’s house if you have a piece of their cutlery or something of the like. This is far more complicated however and requires a DC: 20 Spell Casting check. If you succeed you teleport into the center of that location. If you fail you teleport to a random location within 2d10 Miles.

## Trapped in Animal Form
By attaching dimeritium to a mage who has polymorphed into something else you can trap the mage in that form, unable to use magic or do anything that said animal wouldn’t be able to do.

## Shaking Off Commands
Targets who wish to can attempt another Resist Magic check every 1d6 rounds to throw off the mental command. If they succeed they are able to stop the compulsion.
