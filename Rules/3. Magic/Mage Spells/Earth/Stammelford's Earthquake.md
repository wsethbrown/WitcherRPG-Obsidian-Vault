Effect: Stammelford’s Earthquake allows you to disrupt the ground in a 10m area and create a jagged, crumbling terrain which puts everyone in the area at a -2 to Reflex and a -3 to SPD. Small structures on the shattered ground have a 10% chance of collapsing. Each round, a creature in the spell’s area must make an Athletics roll or sink into the crumbling ground, which causes them to suffocate until they make a successful Athletics check to climb out. After the duration of the spell ends, the ground stops churning but it will remain shattered.
