Mages primarily use a style of magic called spells. Spells are a complex binding of magic which takes energy from an elemental source and channel it into a magical effect which can range from tremendously complex, such as storms of fire and tsunamis, to incredibly sim- ple, such as lighting candles and creating mist. 

Spells require great skill and concentration to perform, and thus only a small percentage of magic users can cast them. Magic users can rarely attain this level of skill and concentration with- out training at one of the magic schools around the world. A skilled mage can cast spells very quickly and often. 

Though casting high-level spells is risky, smaller spells become a daily part of a mage’s life, from dressing in the morning to cooking meals.

## Mixed Element
Some of the spells listed here are impossible without the invocation of at least two elements. These spells are considered mixed element, meaning that they draw power from multiple elements.

## Magic Ranges
You’ll find that the ranges of most spells are very short compared to the greater reach of crossbows and other ranged weapons. This is because containing the power required to cast a spell at greater ranges is very difficult. Mages in combat tend to be similar to grenadiers: great power but shorter range.
