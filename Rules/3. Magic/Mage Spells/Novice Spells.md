># Earth Spells
>For the purposes of magic, earth is used as a catch-all term for both the mineral form of earth and also natural and living things such as plants and animals.
>
># Maintaining Spells
>Spells which are active require maintaining: every round the mage must spend an amount of STA equal to the value next to active. The mage must focus on maintaining this spell and cannot cast other spells while they are maintaining an active spell.

># Telepathic Spying
>You can use Telepathy to silently listen to a target’s thoughts. This works the same as regular telepathy. If the target has a witcher medallion this will cause it to vibrate, and if the target is a mage and has Magic Training, they get a chance each round to detect the telepathic spying by rolling Magic Training against your initial Telepathy roll.

># Fine Telekinesis
When manipulating an object with Telekinesis, you are basically just bending powerful wind around it. This al lows you to lift objects, push objects, and to some extent hold objects. Any skill-based task you try to perform with Telekinesis, such as tripping a foe, maneuvering something through an obstacle course, or (god help you) swinging a sword, uses your Will and Spell Casting at a -3. Complex actions like picking locks, firing bows, and loading crossbows are incredibly difficult, taking a -5. If you choose to throw something with telekinesis use your WILL stat instead of your BODY to calculate range.

># Brands
Only a surgeon can obliterate words burned into skin by a Brand of Fire. A doctor can remove a scar by rolling a DC:15 Healing Hands check. A brand is too large to remove, but after treatment it won’t spell anything out anymore.
>
># Blind Teleporting
You can teleport to a place you don’t know as long as you have an item from that location. For instance you can teleport to a stranger’s house if you have a piece of their cutlery or something of the like. This is far more complicated however and requires a DC: 20 Spell Casting check. If you succeed you teleport into the center of that location. If you fail you teleport to a random location within 2d10 Miles.

># Trapped in Animal Form
By attaching dimeritium to a mage who has polymorphed into something else you can trap the mage in that form, unable to use magic or do anything that said animal wouldn’t be able to do.
>
># Shaking Off Commands
Targets who wish to can attempt another Resist Magic check every 1d6 rounds to throw off the mental command. If they succeed they are able to stop the compulsion.
