Description: Sturdy, accuracte, and powerful. Call me biased but I love the cross- bow. Sure, takes some time to re- load. But a quick arbalist can put bolts downrange with the kind of accuracy most human-made bows can only dream of. The wooden stock allows ya to rest it against your shoulder and aim along it, which makes the shot fly far truer. I used one of these in the Second Northern War and it served me well
