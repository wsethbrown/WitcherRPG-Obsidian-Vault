Description: As a merchant you have to leave your personal prejudices behind for good product. The Mettinese esboda is one of the lightest, sharpest cavalry blades I’ve ever seen. It’s sort of like a much better gleddyf. Count on the black ones to rely on their “vassals” to make better weap- ons, eh?
