Description: Spears are the infantryman’s fa- vorite weapon. Ain’t exactly small, two meters on average, but they’ll hold enemies at bay and deter cav- alry charges. As a man who once served as a battlefield arbalist I have a special fondness for spears. We had a group of spearmen to pro- tect us from the black ones’ cavalry.
