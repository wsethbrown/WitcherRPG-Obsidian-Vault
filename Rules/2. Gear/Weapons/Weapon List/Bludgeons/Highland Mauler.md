Description: The Kaedweni are big folks. If I had to list the toughest sons of whores in the world, it’d be the Skelligers, the Kaedweni, and the Gemmerians. But the Highland Mauler gives the Kaedweni a nice edge. Only ever sold two in my life, but these things are immense. Near two meters tall with a wide iron head that’s inlaid with meteorite steel
