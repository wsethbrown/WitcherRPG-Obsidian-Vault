Description: Now, halflings are smaller than humans but not as sturdy as a dwarf. Not gonna say they’re weak, but ya don’t see armies of halflings. This dagger plays to a halfling’s strengths. It’s thin and strong with a circular pommel and guard. It’s designed to be shoved in between the cracks of armor and leave bleeding wounds.
