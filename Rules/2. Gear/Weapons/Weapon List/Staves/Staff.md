Description: Don’t tell anyone I sold you this, got it? My friend, only safe place to go with a mage’s staff is Skellige, or maybe Zerrikania or Ofier. It may just be a glowy stick to a non-magic user but a staff amplifies a mage’s power, lettin’ ‘em use more magic than normal. But with the hatred of mages in the North and the dis- trust of mages in the South it’s also a great big target.
