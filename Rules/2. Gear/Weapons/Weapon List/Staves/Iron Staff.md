Description: Sometimes a mage might need a bit more protection or, hell, their magic may fail them. In that case ya got an iron staff. Basically it’s just a big rod of iron with fifth essence coursin’ through it. Sturdier than a normal staff and hits like a mace. Ya can even block blades with it a bit.
