Description: Never understood this design my- self, but the young mage I traveled with said it was based off of an old design the mage Alzur used. Turns out Alzur used the hook on the end of the staff to shepherd the beasts he’d make. Imagine his was proba- bly silver but it’s still a useful weap- on for those mages that practice staff fightin’.
