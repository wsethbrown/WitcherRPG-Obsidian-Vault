Description: Been lucky enough to wear a Lyrian leather jacket once. Holy hell, felt like I was wearin’ damn plate armor. The Lyrians treat their leath- er in some special way that makes it tough as a basilisk’s hide. Let the merchant shoot me with a long bow and it didn’t even scratch me! May have been a bit sloshed at the time.
