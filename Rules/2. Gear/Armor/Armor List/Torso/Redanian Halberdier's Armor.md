Description: Heh, strange enough, Redanian halberdiers don’t wear too much armor. Simple leather and cloth gambesons that reach down to the knees, a chain shirt, a gorget, and pauldrons. Guess when you’re at the end of a halberd you don’t need heavy armor. This’ll still take a blade and be maneuverable as a gambeson.
