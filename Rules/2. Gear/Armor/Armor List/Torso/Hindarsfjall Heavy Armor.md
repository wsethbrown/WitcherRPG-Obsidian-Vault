Description: Been to Skellige once or twice in my life. Went to Hindarsfjall a long time ago to visit the temple of Freya. Outside they had swords- men wearin’ this beastly armor. It’s heavy chain down to the knees with hardened leather under it and stud- ded leather over the top, an’ a thick kidney belt. Think this stuff could deflect a damn halberd.
