Description: The Aedirnians probably had it the worst when Nilfgaard attacked. Lost their king—not even sure whether they had a new king be- fore a wave of black and gold hit ‘em. The Aedirnian gambeson’s evidence of that. Just a gambeson with scraps of leather and hardened hide stitched on here and there.
