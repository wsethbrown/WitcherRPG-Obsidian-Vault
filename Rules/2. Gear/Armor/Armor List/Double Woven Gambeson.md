Description: Like the hood of the same construc- tion the double woven gambeson’s decent work on a budget. It’ll stop a cheap sword or a hand crossbow bolt and it won’t weigh ya down too much. I usually wear one of these when I’m travelin’, and around town. Good way to stay safe without people thinkin’ much of it.
