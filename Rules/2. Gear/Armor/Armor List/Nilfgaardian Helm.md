Description: The black ones’ helms are of an in- terestin’ two-part design. First part’s a domed sallet helmet with a sec- tion cut out of the front, or a visor to see out of. Second part’s a bevor that protects the neck and juts up in front of the mouth and nose. To- gether it makes a pretty protective design.
