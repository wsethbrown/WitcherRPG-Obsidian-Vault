Description: Great helms are for the highest of knights. Heh, large, cylindrical hel- mets with larger slots for the eyes and enough ventilation holes to breathe clear. They’re tough as all hell and they’re usually decorated with braided tassles, horns, and spread-winged eagles. Heh, gaudy as hell but useful.
