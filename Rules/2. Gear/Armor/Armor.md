# Armor
Armor has different values that determine how well it protects its wearer and how hinder- ing it might be in the heat of combat. While heavy armor will always mean more protection, light armor is much more maneuverable.
>[!aside]
># EV & Magic
>There’s a reason mages wear robes. Not only is EV subtracted from your Reflex and Dexterity, it is also subtract- ed from your Hex Weaving, Ritual Crafting, and Spell Casting rolls to reflect the difficult of casting complex magic in stiff or heavy armor.
>
># Resistances
>Some armor comes with resistances. These resistances halve damage from certain types of attacks, after the armor’s stopping power has been subtracted. Hu- man-made armor doesn’t usually have resistances without the use of armor enhancements (see pg.90), but non-human armor often does.
