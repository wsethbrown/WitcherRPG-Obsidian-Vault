vuln1: WHIP TONGUE If you successfully parry a grave hag’s tongue attack with a bladed weapon, it is severed. The grave hag takes 5 points of damage and can- not use its tongue again.

ability1: SKULL CIRCLE A grave hag can take 1 hour to make a skull circle. If they are within 100m of their skull circle they get +3 to all actions.
ability2: COMMAND THE UNDEAD Instead of attacking, a grave hag can give a command to each necrophage within 20m. The necrophages will carry out this order instead of acting normally. The order cannot be more complex than ‘grab that thing and bring it here’ or ‘go there and wait’.
ability3: NIGHT VISION Grave hags operate in areas of dim light with no penalties.
